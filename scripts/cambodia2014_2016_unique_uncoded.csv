With support from ADB and the World Bank Group, the Government of Cambodia (the Government) prepared the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), comprising seven investment projects and the proposed technical assistance (TA). The resource envelope for SPCR is $385 million including $86 million from PPCR and $299 million in co-financing from ADB and other development partners. The PPCR sub-committee endorsed SPCR in June 2011. The TA will promote synergies between CCA and disatser risk reduction, sets up a common framework for monitoring and evaluation of all SPCR projects, and develops a knowledge and communications plan for each component that will be critical to sustaining the impact and effectiveness of current and future climate resilience investments. The TA will (i) strengthen capacity to coordinate all SPCR investments and to mainstream adaptation concerns into national and sub-national planning, budgeting and development in Cambodia; (ii) conduct feasibility studies for priority projects of the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) with a view to secure additional funds from sources such as Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund; (iii) establish a civil society support mechanism to fund community-based adaptation activities and strengthen capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to mainstream climate resilience into their operations; and (iv) generate and disseminate knowledge for climate change adaptation (CCA) in various sectors. The expected impact of the TA is enhanced resilience to climate change in Cambodia leading to improved livelihoods, especially for vulnerable groups including women and children. By 2022, the number of households affected and economic losses resulting from extreme climate events will be reduced by 20% from the 2012 baseline. The expected outcome of the TA is sustained institutional and technical capacity to integrate adaptation concerns into development. By 2018, agreed strategies on adaptation will be integrated into at least three sectors. Also, at least 25% of projects in water resources, agriculture, transport, water supply and sanitation will be climate-proofed. By the TA end, it is expected that (i) risk screening tools are applied for projects in irrigation, flood prevention, agriculture, biodiversity, roads, water supply and sanitation, and urban development; and (ii) vulnerability assessments incorporating climate information are performed for projects determined at risk in key sectors.The TA is expected to deliver four outputs:1.

Its specific purpose is to support local governments and local government associations (LGAs) in these countries to enable them to provide more effective services that advance sustainable and equitable local economic development.    The FCM co-manages the project with the seven national LGAs. Technical assistance is provided to LGAs to increase their capacity for policy development and political representation, so that national legislation, regulations and policies are supportive of an increased local government role in economic development. As well, technical assistance supports their efforts to establish training and knowledge-sharing programs on sustainable and equitable economic development.    The project concentrates on key areas important to local governments' ability to provide an efficient and attractive operating environment for both large and small-scale businesses. Up to 15 demonstration projects are undertaken in selected local governments of the seven target countries. Up to three local governments are involved in each demonstration project for a total of up to 45 local governments directly benefitting from the program. These projects focus on: (a) local economic governance, including political leadership (men, women and youth leaders), business development advocacy, local economic development planning, and business and community engagement; (b) municipal services to businesses; and (c) revenue generation, and access to financing. The demonstration projects aim to create positive changes in the local governments involved. They also help the LGAs to exemplify or advocate for policy and legislative changes, and to provide examples of best practices to be disseminated to other local governments in the country and the region.

In the 2013 wet season, severe floods impacted 20 provinces in Cambodia. Following on from existing projects, $7.6 million additional funds were allocated to address the damages by 2013 floods and to increase coverage of rehabilitation of economic infrastructure. The projects are focused in six selected provinces. 1) National and Provincial Roads Rehabilitation - 119km of flood damaged national and provincial roads ( and drainage structures)  and 3 bridges  in 5 provinces reconstructed; 2) Rural Road Rehabilitation - 257km of flood damaged rural roads (and drainage structures) in 5 provinces reconstructed; 3) Irrigation Rehabilitation and Flood Management. At least 9 flood damaged irrigation schemes reconstructed; and 4) Project Management and Facilitation. The total value of this initiative is $12.6 million over 3 years, starting 2011-12.",,

The region includes Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and China's Yunnan Province. This integration is in line with market-oriented reforms in China, moves toward establishing an ASEAN economic community, and trend toward greater regional economic integration, including the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. One of the key consequences of this trend has been the significant growth of foreign direct investment from China in the region, particularly in the low-income countries of Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. Chinese investment has grown rapidly for the following reasons: -China's proximity to the region; -increased ease of cross-border trade, investment capital, and people flows; and,-attractive regulatory and policy environment. Investment from China has generally involved production of low-tech, labour intensive, and land intensive products which have directly and indirectly affected the course of economic development, industrial structure, and local labour market and enterprise development.This research project looks at the impacts of Chinese investment on local economies and on local enterprise development in Laos and Cambodia. Both countries have challenges managing, promoting, and maximizing the benefits of foreign direct investment, especially in terms of employment and building local economic activity. However, there are few studies examining the impacts of foreign investment on local enterprises in the region, and of the positive and negative spillover effects.China's size and the nature of these interventions, policies, and incentives make its investments particularly interesting from a policy perspective. The project will broaden understanding of the impact of Chinese investment at the industrial structure and local enterprise levels. It will review existing policies and regulations within each of the countries, assess the impact of Chinese investment on industrial structure, examine spillover effects on local enterprises, and provide policy recommendations to maximize benefits and mitigate negative impacts.Researchers from the School of Economics and Management at Kunming University of Science and Technology will collaborate with researchers at the Faculty of Economics and Business Management at the National University of Laos, and the Cambodia Economics Association. The project will help increase researchers' capacity to conduct economic analysis and apply research methods. Activities will include short courses for emerging young researchers, mentorship, technical advisory support, and collaborative research.",,

This project will refine proven innovations in homestead food production and will test cost-sharing, financial, and social impact models at scale to improve nutrition, income, and gender equity. Testing homestead food production approachesHomestead food production empowers the poor with the education and resources they need to raise their own nutritious foods. The project team will ask men and women smallholders living in Cambodia's upland, lowland, and forested regions to self-select from four food production options:-backyard gardens alone-gardens plus fish-gardens plus poultry-gardens plus poultry and fishResearchers from the University of British Columbia and Helen Keller International will identify barriers to participation and factors that motivate farmers to adopt and invest in the intervention. They will integrate underlying factors that influence nutritional outcomes including water, sanitation, and hygiene practices. The project builds on previous research testing homestead food production with vegetable gardens in combination with fish ponds to grow nutrient-dense small fish for household consumption and large fish for sale. The earlier research found that nutritional quality was enhanced, incomes improved, and women had a greater role in household decision-making.Better nutrition, improved food securityAt the end of three years, 22,500 households and 135,000 individuals are expected to benefit directly and indirectly. The project will provide a package of homestead food production options that can be quickly implemented by government, the public, and the private sector across a Asia and in Africa.

This stems from a lack of crop diversification beyond rice and a lack of nutrient rich foods in the diet. Though several intervention models are being implemented, there is a need to test integrated systems that increase and diversify food production, providing low income households with affordable foods with adequate energy, protein as well as bioavailable forms of essential micronutrients like iron and vitamin A. There is also a need for rigorous evaluation of the actual impact of agricultural interventions on nutritional status. This project led by the Helen Keller International, Cambodia and the University of British Columbia, Canada, aims to improve household food security and nutrition outcomes, livelihoods and women s empowerment through an integrated homestead food production which innovatively combines small-scale aquaculture. Research will be conducted through a randomized control trial using baseline and follow-up surveys to determine the impact of the intervention on household food security, nutritional status and livelihoods.

IMF and World Bank have recently completed the first financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on Cambodia that will provide useful inputs to the update of the 10-year FSDS.  While FSP I has been rated successful by the independent evaluation department (IED), some of the reform measures were not widely enforced due to weak interministerial coordination and capacity constraint.  Prepared within the framework of the updated FSDS, the next program cluster (FSP III) will help complete some of the reform programs that commenced during FSP II, strengthen the enforcement of completed activities, and commence reform activities in leasing, capital market, and pension fund. The expected overall impact of the cluster program is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance mobilization of financial resources to support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome of the FSP III is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. FSP III is expected to be approved in November 2011.

A strong anti-ivory message aims to reduce local and regional demand and complicity in the transport of ivory into, through, and out of Cambodia. Specific project activities will include: 1) delivery of education curriculum to rural schools in the Cardamom Mountains, Kompong Som and Phnom Penh, focusing on threats to flagship species; 2) improving the understanding of key environmental issues among teachers, community educators, and leaders through training, staff development, monitoring and evaluation, and provide multiple-use long lasting educational materials; 3) conduct field trips to Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center for students and community members; 4) conducting 15+ interactive hands-on Community Night Shows; 5) conduct anti-ivory and wildlife ID trainings with Customs and Excise officers at primary points of entry; 6) raise awareness on the devastating effects of the illegal wildlife trade with a focus on elephants and ivory through community outreach programs, installation of billboards, and posting hotline stickers on 10 tuk-tuks in Phnom Penh, promoting Wildlife Alliance's 24-hour nationwide wildlife crime hotline.

All these economies (with the exception of Thailand) are overcoming legacies of heavy-handed centralized governments in which the private sector had a very limited role. Since the 1990s, foreign investment and a vast pool of workers have catapulted the economies of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and more recently Burma, to the category of fastest growing low-income countries. Their garments, electronics, food processing and other industries have rapidly joined global value chains and employed millions of workers. As these countries continue their fast economic transformation, the generation of more jobs with better working conditions for the growing numbers of youth is becoming a major challenge. The project will contribute to addressing this challenge by supporting a regional network of researchers to examine current policies and practices to upgrade skills and improve working conditions for young, low-skilled workers, mainly women and those belonging to ethnic communities. A leading think tank (the Cambodia Development Resource Institute, CDRI) will be the hub of the network, which will launch a first-ever competitive research call for up to 12 research ideas from other regional think tanks and non-government organizations. Some of the subprojects would include pilot ideas to be scalable in the future. CDRI will provide oversight of the research and link it to the wider community of policymakers, private sector and civil society in the Greater Mekong region and ASEAN.",,

The intervention is designed to promote active citizenship through a human rights based approach and a strategy of change that stresses awareness raising, organizing and collective action and advocacy as means to enable the right holders to actively participate in the planning and implementation of initiatives that benefit them and improve their access to rights.To this end, Diakonia will continue to provide financial support (mainly in the form of core-funding) and capacity building to a number of local partner organisations (for 2014, the number is 13). In line with the strategy of change, Diakonia will support the development away from a civil society dominated by professional NGOs and top-down service delivery organisations towards a more pluralistic, more empowering, more representative, more independent, less elitist, more gender equal and more democratically organized civil society.The intervention is built around three broad results areas: 1) Democracy; 2) Gender equality; and 3) Human Rights. Promoting democratic values and defending democratic freedoms where they are at risk constitute key principles of the intervention. Actions relating to freedom of assembly, association and expression are particularly pronounced, along with other initiatives trying to counteract infringements of democratic rights. ICT technology is recognized as a key tool for communication, evidence-based advocacy and data collection as well as a means to organise and form associations.The proposed form of Swedish financing is through a grant, which is deemed appropriate for the type of capacity development support that Diakonia is providing. The intervention will be implemented as a project since there are no programme-based alternatives. Diakonia will channel part of the funds to third parties (i.e. local CSOs). Sweden is currently the only donor. Coordination among donors and other stakeholders however remains relevant in order to share information, good practices and lessons learned and to avoid overlapping activities.",,

In the extension proposal, Diakonia concludes that ICT has proved to be a valuable resource for human rights defenders in Cambodia, and that the four partner organisations in the ICT-project are now integrating ICT into all their core awareness raising activities, civil society mobilizing and evidence based advocacy. New ICT-tools are also being used for cost-effective and safe internal communication.Diakonia also concludes that while the foundations have been established during the two-year-project period, continued efforts are needed to build capacity, increase the pool of activists and audience reach, and explore new ICT tools that can be used in the human rights defense and promotion work. The extension period will be used to consolidate the collaborative work between Diakonia and its current four partners. The partners include three human rights organisations; Community Legal Education Center (CLEC), Cambodian League for Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO) and Samakum Theang Tnaot (STT) and one media organization; Cambodian Centre for Independent Media (CCIM). It is expected that the continued support will contribute to make some of the key human rights organisations more efficient and effective in their work. It is also expected to create an environment for more accurate and stringent information collection and transmission. The support provided for the extension period amounts to SEK 2.5 million, which makes the total Swedish financial support to this contribution amount to SEK 9.2 million covering the period from January 2013 to December 2015.",,

Rainfed lowland rice, grown once a year in the wet season, is the backbone of agricultural production, but is largely subsistence-oriented with low productivity. Household income would be increased and rural poverty reduced if quality rice and non-rice crops could be successfully grown. The aim of this project is to identify mechanisation options and post-harvest technologies to enhance household livelihoods and food security in lowland rice-growing areas. This will be achieved by utilising a systems approach, integrating mechanised cropping practices, including combine harvesting, and post-harvest practices, in particular artificial dryers, that together increase the intensification, potential for diversification, the labour efficiency of the cropping system and the market value of the produce.",,

The aim of this project is to identify mechanisation options and post-harvest technologies to enhance household livelihoods and food security in lowland rice-growing areas. This will be achieved by utilising a systems approach, integrating mechanised cropping practices, including combine harvesting, and post-harvest practices, in particular artificial dryers, that together increase the intensification, potential for diversification, the labour efficiency of the cropping system and the market value of the produce.",,

Across Asian factories, new management improvements are being tested to advance working conditions and comply with international labour conventions while enhancing productivity and competitiveness. These include training of managers, promotion of work-life balance, and incentive pay. In Vietnam and Indonesia, the ministries of labour have engaged with the international community to implement these programs. New trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership are also opening opportunities for workers and policymakers to support such interventions. There is growing understanding that when factories treat workers fairlyÌ_especially womenÌ_they show greater psychological empowerment to advocate change, while workers who experience verbal and physical abuse by supervisors feel disempowered, their mindset suffers, and they become less productive at work. This research project aims to improve the understanding of the link between working conditions, well-being, and productivity. The project will compare female factory workers that participate in a program with better working conditions with those who do not. It will examine whether compliance with better working conditions affects mindsets, and how in turn this impacts work performance and workers' well-being. It will also assess the development impact of improvement in job quality among young female workers, and what interventions can best address the current conditions of working women in the garment industry.The project will be implemented by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers from the industrial psychology, management science, and economic sectors. They will engage directly with stakeholders in ministries of labour and garment factory associations. The University of Indonesia will involve the working group on decent work within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which tackles labour policies at the regional level. The project will promote collaboration and capacity building of local research teams in Indonesia and Vietnam and will disseminate findings widely to the scholarly, policy, industry, and private sector communities through working papers and briefs as well as targeted public events.",,

khm2_1782,F.a: Land and Livelihood Advocacy Development Project (LLAP),F.A: LAND AND LIVELIHOOD ADVOCACY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LLAP),"Cambodia's 2001 Land Law attempted to limit encroachment into state land (technically about 80% of Cambodia's land area) while providing for legal expansion of smallholder agriculture through the distribution of up to five hectares of state land as 'social land concessions' which would be eligible for title after five years of continuous occupation and use. In 2003, Sub-Decree 19 on Social Land Concessions (SLCs) was enacted which provided for a locally initiated and managed process of planning and implementing SLCs. In late 2005, the State Land Management Sub-Decree provided the legal basis for district and provincial levels of Government to work with communes to identify and officially allocate state lands for SLCs.  Land and Advocacy Development Project (LADP) has been prepared to provide capacity building on Alternative Dispute resolution (ADR) Land Rights and Land Registration, Advocacy, Women Rights, and relevant laws to ensure that the people are aware of ADR and the responsibilities of government and other duty-bearers to fulfill, to protect and respect communities' rights. In addition, the capacity of the duty bearers will be strengthened to be able to fulfill their obligations to realise concerned communities' rights.   Objectives: Ìø To promote democratic participation and human rights at the grassroots level by educating and supporting vulnerable groups, victims of land dispute and local government (Commune Councils) to become more effective at advocating their communities' needs. Ìø To ensure the most vulnerable groups are able to access to their agriculture land and control over productive resources and assets for enhancing their livelihood activities.   Rights- holders /beneficiaries:  Approximately 1 000 households located in 25 villages at selected LWD programme areas in Kampong Speu, Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, Battambang provinces will benefit from the project. The district Cadastral Commission, local authority and LWD staff will benefit from the project through capacity building on Alternative Dispute Resolution.   Implementing partner: Life with Dignity (LWD) LWD has been working together with FCA in partnership for over 20 years to improve the livelihoods of the poor and marginalised in rural Cambodia, engaging both rights-holders and duty-bearers. Since 2011, the partners have been implementing a land rights awareness project in Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces with the aim at increasing awareness on land rights and land registration of vulnerable households who have received land through Social Land Concessions. Land rights and land registration trainings were also provided to district authority representatives, Commune Councils, village leaders, Advocacy Group and implementing partner staff in collaboration with the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC).",,
khm2_1783,F.a: Land and Livelihood Advocacy Development Project (LLAP),F.A: LAND AND LIVELIHOOD ADVOCACY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LLAP),"The number of land conflicts has been significantly increased over the last 10 years in Cambodia. However, the 2001 land law was adopted following other supporting mechanisms. The land demarcation done by the relevant authorities and also the youth volunteers (following Directive 01) has not been clear especially in the land conflict areas. Both the citizens and authorities who have been involved in the conflict and conflict resolution found the difficulties in addressing the issues without statistics and lack of information. Moreover, lack of land certificate and overlapping in certificates has put the land demarcation in difficulties.The aim of Land and Livelihood Advocacy Project (LLAP) is to provide capacity building on basic Alternative Dispute resolution (ADR), Family Law, Land Rights and Land Registration, Advocacy, Women Rights, and other relevant laws through trainings, awareness raising, workshops, commune forums, meetings and dialogue. Expected results: people at the target areas are aware of ADR, their rights are fulfilled and dealing with issues is done in a peaceful manner. This will be achieved when community members are aware of the responsibilities of government and duty-bearers [such as District/Khan Cadastral Commissions (DKCC), Commune Councils (CCs), Local Authorities (LAs)] have improved capacity on Alternative Dispute Resolution and land law to fulfill, to protect and respect communities' rights. Thus the capacity of the duty-bearers will be strengthened to be able to fulfill their obligations to realise the rights of the communities. Rights- holders /beneficiaries: At least 31,787 households located in 25 villages at selected LWD programme areas in Kampong Speu, Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, Battambang provinces will benefit from the project.

Particularly, the Women Agriculture Cooperatives (WACs) still have limited understanding on collective business concept. Group capital mobilisation appears to be needed for expansion of collective business.Responding to these challenges, the project will promote entrepreneurship, continue to support vulnerable women to play an active role to lead and manage Agriculture Cooperatives and establish market linkages through value chain concepts. The project also improves economic status of women through collective business groups, including proper business plans. It also strengthens institutional development through networking and advocacy for business opportunities.   The excepted results are:Ìø Improved business capacity of women leaders in micro and small business group through provision of capacity building and mentoring on business plan to WAC management committee and small business groups and setting up the operational model for micro and small business groups.Ìø Strengthen business networking of WACs and business actors and duty-bearersÌø Improve project staff capacity in providing business mentoring; Training course on the business and value chain based on the capacity assessment aimed at passing on this knowledge and related skills to WACs.Rights-holders /beneficiaries: At least 5000 households, the most vulnerable women, youth and AC smallholders. Implementing partner: Life with Dignity (LWD) is FCA's long-term and strategic partner in Cambodia. LWD has good experience in implementing integrated development and livelihood projects through rights based empowerment approach.

In Cambodia, 65 % of the population is under age of 30, and therefore youth empowerment is an imperative. KYA is dedicated to advocate the government with active and meaningful participation of youth in the decision-making and political process. Robust youth participation is perhaps the strongest mechanism that builds a more democratic society in Cambodia. KYA s core objectives are focused on empowering vulnerable youth, who are at-risk because of conditions such as poverty, limited access to education, unemployment, disability, and/or sickness.Objectives:Ìø To enhance space and opportunities for youth to be actively involved in the society and policy making process Ìø To increase knowledge, skills and awareness of youth on human rights, education and peace.Activities: Ìø Capacity Building in advocacy skills, thematic contents, media advocacy skills, team building, research skills, public speaking, fundraising strategy and proposal writing, constitutional law and law on peaceful assemblyÌø The launch, assembly and meetings of Cambodia Changemaker Network Ìø Monthly advocacy or awareness activity that the network members will implement e.g. via social media and YouTube, which will support the main campaign (2 per year) decided by the network.Rights- holders /beneficiaries: Cambodia Changemaker Network has identified the core to establish the network in 2014, consisting of 22 members (from 7 provinces). KYA has established earlier about 60 Community Youth Networks (CYNs) all over the country (including some of FCA's existing target areas) which actively participate in community development. The youth group members aged 15-35 years are the rights-holders of the project, as well as the wide youth population in Cambodia through campaigns, awareness raising, etc. In addition, the local authorities, government and UN will be targeted.Implementing partner:Khmer Youth Association (KYA) is a humanitarian, non-governmental and non-partisan organization established in 1992, registered by the Ministry of Interior (MoI), Cambodia. KYA is Cambodia's leading non-partisan youth organization working on issues of human rights, democracy, gender equality, and sustainable development.

In 2003, Sub-Decree 19 on Social Land Concessions (SLCs) was enacted which provided for a locally initiated and managed process of planning and implementing SLCs. In late 2005, the State Land Management Sub-Decree provided the legal basis for district and provincial levels of Government to work with communes to identify and officially allocate state lands for SLCs.Land and Advocacy Development Project (LADP) has been prepared to provide capacity building on Alternative Dispute resolution (ADR) Land Rights and Land Registration, Advocacy, Women Rights, and relevant laws to ensure that the people are aware of ADR and the responsibilities of government and other duty-bearers to fulfill, to protect and respect communities' rights. In addition, the capacity of the duty bearers will be strengthened to be able to fulfill their obligations to realise concerned communities' rights. Objectives:Ìø To promote democratic participation and human rights at the grassroots level by educating and supporting vulnerable groups, victims of land dispute and local government (Commune Councils) to become more effective at advocating their communities' needs.Ìø To ensure the most vulnerable groups are able to access to their agriculture land and control over productive resources and assets for enhancing their livelihood activities.

Implementing partner: Life with Dignity (LWD)LWD has been working together with FCA in partnership for over 20 years to improve the livelihoods of the poor and marginalised in rural Cambodia, engaging both rights-holders and duty-bearers. Since 2011, the partners have been implementing a land rights awareness project in Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces with the aim at increasing awareness on land rights and land registration of vulnerable households who have received land through Social Land Concessions.

The low levels of literacy and education limit women's options for generating sufficient income for decent living which exposes them and their children to the risk of exploitation and violence. In addition, low family incomes and social attitudes all combine to create numerous barriers to girls attending or remaining in school, causing them to drop out before completing their basic education and thereby increasing their vulnerability. Women and girls also have less voice and thus little influence in decision-making processes in their communities due to prevailing gender stereotypes.The target area of the project is Siem Reap province which is one of the poorest provinces of Cambodia, with a high number of female-headed households, most of whom are poor and under considerable economic and social stress. Project objectives include:Ìø Empowered women are able to generate income through group businesses and small enterprisesÌø Clusters of savings groups formed into Federations in the target areas to provide support to vulnerable women to curb financial crisis and all forms of violenceÌø Girls from poor families living in the target areas are empowered through access to education (scholarships, vocational and life skills training)  Rights-holders /beneficiaries: The most vulnerable women and girls including women from poor families, landless and women recovering from violence; men and boys will also benefit directly and indirectly from saving groups and community awareness; CWCC staff, family members of targeted women, community members, partner NGOs and members of local authorities.

According to the recent statistics, there are 1,4 million working children in Cambodia. Within the most dangerous forms of labor, the working conditions are extremely damaging to health. Thousands of children lack opportunities for education because of being forced to work. This results to a cycle of illiteracy and poverty. In Cambodia, the society doesn't recognize the need to protect children from exploitation and significant gaps do exist in official child protection structures, which makes it important for NGOs to contribute in this field.The project opposes child labor exploitation by developing groups and networks in different community sectors to monitor, investigate and refer to child rights (CR) violations. Wider audience is reached through activities that disseminate information on CR and on how to correctly respond to violations. The project also aims to contribute to the prevention of CR violations in Cambodia and to the protection and rehabilitation of victims of the violations.The project is located in both rural and urban areas in Phnom Penh and its surroundings and the provinces of Kandal, Koh Kong, Preah Sihanouk and Siem Reap.The first project phase has been successful in establishing local level Child Protection Groups (PG), especially Child PGs in the target communities. The public awareness and debate about Child Rights and risks of the Child Labour is also increasing. This continuation phase of the project (2014-2015) will be dedicated especially to strengthening the existing Child Protection Groups as part of the local level civil societies.

With the strong relationship with members of the local communities and other activist groups, effective one-step-ahead-approach, and through the use of a savvy media campaign, Mother Nature has been able to delay the process and make the Areng Valley a talking point. During this project, Mother Nature will continue taking advantage of its rapport with influential community members to ensure that the communities at large are fully informed of what their rights are, and feel empowered enough (with the necessary tools, contacts and strategies) to publicly oppose the project. Also, Mother Nature will increase its media campaign to highlight the massive inconsistencies with the dam, pointing at not just the usual human rights violations and the massive ecological footprint, but also highlighting the fact that it has been classed as 'uneconomical' by two large dam builders. This will be done through the use of a newly created network, which will concentrate its efforts in punctual, public, and innovative activities / campaigns. Mother Nature organization was created in February 2013 in the village of Ta Tay Leu, Koh Kong province, which was seeing massive deforestation of its ancient sacred spirit forests. Mother Nature has successfully campaigned agaist illegal logging, and has built a broad-based movement to stop the proposed Chhay Areng dam, as it would severely damage the unique biodiversity of the area and seriously infringe on the human rights of local indigenous communities. The goals of Mother Nature are: 1) To prevent the proposed Chhay Areng hydroelectric dam, or any other-large scale development projects, from being approved inside the Central Cardamom Protected Forest (CCPF); 2) Protect, reinforce, and promote the unique culture, traditions, and livelihoods of the Cardamom Mountain s remaining forest-dependant indigenous communities; 3) Lobby the Cambodian government to declare the whole of the CCPF area a UNESCO World Heritage Site; 4) Increase international pressure on protecting the forest area by leveraging national and international civil society networks, social media and mainstream media; 5) Encourage tourists and researchers to visit the Cardamoms in order to learn more about these unique and endangered landscapes as well as help create jobs and income in the area; 6) To become Cambodia's first green movement, made of environmentally aware Cambodians.

khm2_1906,Gender aspects of electoral violence: Surveying political candidates in Myanmar and Cambodia,GENDER ASPECTS OF ELECTORAL VIOLENCE: SURVEYING POLITICAL CANDIDATES IN MYANMAR AND CAMBODIA,"This project seeks to explore intimidation and violence targeting politicians, with a particular focus on potential gender differences. It distinguishes itself from existing research on election violence in at least three ways: it focuses on a region less researched by zooming in on Asia (Cambodia and Myanmar), it focuses on violence directly targeting politicians, and, importantly, it explores gender differences in the type of intimidation and violence experienced.Election violence is an important issue from a number of perspectives. Understanding the causes and consequences of inter-personal physical violence is always relevant and important, but election violence also violates a fundamental democratic principle: free and fair elections. Seen from a democratic perspective, election violence is often used in order to affect electoral outcomes or to intimidate or threaten certain politicians from running a campaign or delivering their message. Election violence is therefore more than a violation of personal integrity; it also violates electoral integrity and decreases democratic quality (Norris 2013)By taking its starting-point in electoral integrity, the relevant definition of election violence here departs from the purpose of the violent acts. Acts of intimidation, threats, physical and psychological violence with the purpose of affecting an electoral outcome or preventing someone from running in an election are all relevant acts to focus on from this perspective. This means that the range of activities defined as election violence is broad and should not be confined to an exclusive focus on physical violence. While physical violence can influence elections in very direct ways, by preventing candidates from campaigning or standing for elections, threats and intimidation create fear and can be highly efficient means to influence individual decisions (Hè glund 2009). It is also when looking at election violence from an electoral integrity perspective that we come to realize that different forms of violence and intimidation may be targeting different types of people. A report that has documented incidents of election violence does suggest that there is a gendered dimension that needs further scrutiny. The report indicates that while female victims of election violence most often reported intimidation and psychological abuse, male victims typically experienced physical violence taking place in the public sphere (Bardall 2011). So far, no study has applied these insights to the experiences of politicians during elections.If there are, indeed, diverging experiences of male and female politicians during election periods, we need to design studies that are able to capture these different experiences. This project will build on earlier research as well as practical experiences in order to do so. It will combine insights from aggregated studies of incidents of election violence and interview-based case studies to design a survey study that records individ",,

There are a number of reasons for this. Reporting of tobacco-related disease is low. Treatment for anything other than infectious disease or trauma is often unavailable.Cambodian policymakers have expressed the need for convincing and reliable information on the health costs of smoking, particularly in light of the draft tobacco control law, which is due for Parliamentary approval, and an upcoming tobacco taxation increase.This research project will generate knowledge about the direct healthcare costs of active tobacco use and the indirect productivity losses of active tobacco use. Researchers will examine the costs associated with five disease groups: -lung cancers;-tuberculosis (TB);-ischemic heart disease;-stroke (cerebrovascular disease); and, -chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They will not estimate the costs associated with second-hand smoke, the cost of tobacco purchase, or the cost of using tobacco products which are not smoked.There is strong evidence from other countries that smoking increases the TB infection rate and reduces tuberculosis survival rates. Cambodia has high TB and smoking rates, so the cost of tobacco use will also include the cost of excess tuberculosis-related deaths. Cambodia s health information systems are weak and unreliable. As a result, data will be collected only in major health facilities located in Phnom Penh and large regional facilities. Local health information databases and health service personnel will help establish the annual number of cases. Researchers will determine the costs per case through surveys and interviews with health personnel. They will calculate the indirect costs due to productivity losses using secondary data on World Health Organization disability adjusted life year estimates. They will also conduct a small number of case studies to determine the costs of treatment and care of tobacco-caused disease to individuals and families.",,

Many improved varieties have been released for growing in Cambodia but their uptake has been small. Recent gains in breeding methods and access to molecular tools place rice improvement programs in a much stronger position to rapidly develop new varieties and to fine-tune existing germplasm. This project will seek to develop more suitable varieties for both the wet and dry seasons in Cambodia.

The program also aims to increase demand for health services at the community level; reduce maternal and newborn mortality by increasing uptake of antenatal care and delivery and newborn care via linkages with the HIV and AIDS program; and improve the availability and quality of blood supply. The program will be implemented under sector-wide management (SWiM), which has most of the characteristics of a sector-wide approach (SWAp) but does not require a common funding basket or the complete adoption of common implementation arrangements. Sector-wide management significantly increases opportunities for coordination of efforts and provides flexibility for the allocation of scarce resources.

The region includes Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and China s Yunnan Province. This integration is in line with market-oriented reforms in China, moves toward establishing an ASEAN economic community, and trend toward greater regional economic integration, including the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. One of the key consequences of this trend has been the significant growth of foreign direct investment from China in the region, particularly in the low-income countries of Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. Chinese investment has grown rapidly for the following reasons: -China s proximity to the region; -increased ease of cross-border trade, investment capital, and people flows; and,-attractive regulatory and policy environment. Investment from China has generally involved production of low-tech, labour intensive, and land intensive products which have directly and indirectly affected the course of economic development, industrial structure, and local labour market and enterprise development.This research project looks at the impacts of Chinese investment on local economies and on local enterprise development in Laos and Cambodia. Both countries have challenges managing, promoting, and maximizing the benefits of foreign direct investment, especially in terms of employment and building local economic activity. However, there are few studies examining the impacts of foreign investment on local enterprises in the region, and of the positive and negative spillover effects.China s size and the nature of these interventions, policies, and incentives make its investments particularly interesting from a policy perspective. The project will broaden understanding of the impact of Chinese investment at the industrial structure and local enterprise levels. It will review existing policies and regulations within each of the countries, assess the impact of Chinese investment on industrial structure, examine spillover effects on local enterprises, and provide policy recommendations to maximize benefits and mitigate negative impacts.Researchers from the School of Economics and Management at Kunming University of Science and Technology will collaborate with researchers at the Faculty of Economics and Business Management at the National University of Laos, and the Cambodia Economics Association. The project will help increase researchers  capacity to conduct economic analysis and apply research methods. Activities will include short courses for emerging young researchers, mentorship, technical advisory support, and collaborative research.",,

With the ASEAN Economic Community in sight, more and more border zones are being designated as special economic zones. These zones host labour-intensive industries such as garments, which predominantly employ young, migrant women. The project focuses on how the garment industry at the borders shape women's empowerment through employment. The study examines how migrant women and their work and lives at border zones differ from those in more central locations. The ambivalence of border areas creates both opportunities and risks in generating an empowering labour regime for women. The study will employ both quantitative and qualitative data collection for gender analysis, using economic, sociological, and ethnographic techniques to answer questions such as: Does border development create more employment opportunities? Does it allow women to keep closer ties with their communities of origin? Does it create space where there is little or no protection? Does it create a space where women and men can break free from gender roles back home? The project will interview about 1,000 workers in more than 20 factories to learn about their employment history, personal background, family relationships, reproductive history, health issues, childcare and general working conditions. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions will follow to learn more about their perceived difficulties, coping strategies, their identities and relations with others, as well as their prospects for the future. Researchers will share findings with garment factory owners and associations, government officials dealing with border development, civil society and other regional stakeholders to trigger a discussion on gender-sensitive improvements in policies and practices. Research will be carried out mainly in the Thai town of Mae Sot (Myanmar-Thailand border) and the Cambodian town of Bavet (Cambodia-Thailand border). The Gender and Development Program at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) will lead the research, in collaboration with the Mekong Migrant Network, a regional non-government organization that promotes migrant workers' well-being. The project is co-funded by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and Japan's Toyota Foundation.",,

In doing so, the project aims at reaching two main objectives: 1) diverse citizen groups more effectively voice their needs and feedback to influence sub-national administration decisions 2) sub-national administrations address more citizen issues. Pact will implement the project together with five local NGOs in Cambodia who in their turn support community based organisations, grass-root organisations and individuals across four provinces and twelve district/municipalities.

Sweden has supported the Parliamentary Institute of Cambodia (PIC) since its inception in 2011, for the reason to fill the role in parliament described above. In a very short time span, PIC has established itself as a center for research and capacity support within the parliament. Its institutional capacity has been assessed by the Swedish Parliaments Research Service (Riksdagens utredningstj‰Û¡nst, RUT), and through a capacity assessment on behalf of the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC). Both studies were conducted in 2014. Even though weaknesses have been noted in both RUT's and SDC's studies, for example insufficient capacity to deliver on all research orders and that PIC still needs strengthening on gender equality and monitoring aspects, there is a common view that PICs has the capacity to execute on its mandate and contribute to a better functioning parliament.The first phase is nearing completion and in August 2014 PIC submitted a new  proposal to Sida for the period 2014 to 2017 with a total budget of USD 7.104.000 million, or approximately SEK 51.80 million. The intervention aims to contribute to building a strong and democratic parliament in Cambodia in the long-run by providing parliamentary research services to assist parliamentarians of both houses; facilitate outreach of the research through engagement with parliamentary clients or commissions and their constituents; developing institutional capacity of PIC's and parliamentary secretariat's staffs and forging regional cooperation and networking with other like-minded research institutes. The intervention is, furthermore, expected to foster greater and more focused dialogues between constituents and their parliamentarians, and enable citizens to voice their views more meaningfully and frequently. Of the overall requested budget by PIC, which is 51.80 MSEK, it is suggested that Sida will contribute SEK 13.2 million for PIC's activities and another SEK 0,3 million for an evaluation. SDC will contribute SEK 22.60 million and the Cambodian parliament will further provide another SEK 5 million in-kind contribution (primarily office space located in the Senate compound) and approximately 10.61 MSEK will be additionally sought by PIC from other donors in 2016 and 2017.

This tendency is deepening the crisis of peacebuilding which by now is well documented. Predictably, the international community keeps pursuing intervention with either military means or with a one-dimensional liberal peace approach through intrusive interventions, has had difficulties dealing with this more complex situation. As a consequence of the imperative of pursuing peacebuilding in the midst of violence, the theoretical metaphor of a security-development nexus is naturally brought forward, heralded as it is in the policy world. This nexus is however contested, misused and imprecise, allowing vested interests to liberally pursue their agenda. In this project we aim to follow how the nexus is created in the hierarchies of donor headquarters and travels to its localized version, and catch how this nexus is being transformed, re-created, and resisted in the localized context for which it is ultimately created, but rarely applied, and even less researched. We have selected four case studies which have explicitly worked with the security-development nexus, namely DRC, Somalia, Colombia, and Cambodia.

After the Khmer Rouge period and the Vietnamese occupation (1974 -1994) medical care and medical infrastructure were totally inadequate in Cambodia. The Red Cross and AZG ( Medicines Without Frontiers) started with primary health care and set up first -aid hospitals. Meanwhile, AZG contacted a number of French, Belgian and Swiss universities to start up a new and adjusted medical training programme. UGent has taken up his role through a VLIR -UOS Own Initiative project in 1994, in which the objective was to train trainers in basic medical sciences and general surgery. As a result 6 PhD s in surgery were realised. These doctors are currently in charge within the medical faculty of the local partner. Once the medical basic training was re -started, the focus was shifted to re -initiating the training of 2nd -line hospital doctors, taking on a thematic approach. UGent opted to focus on the second cause of cancer death in Cambodia:  gastrointestinal cancer . A second Own Initiative was started in 2007 to get a better understanding of gastrointestinal tumours in Cambodia, which has lead to a better understanding of carcinoma in general and its treatment in Cambodia in particular. Currently, there is an increased awareness on the government level that they need a national cancer plan, in which the reference centre for gastrointestinal carcinoma plays a key role, in relation to both prevention and therapeutic treatment.Traditionally, public health in LMIC s has focused on low cost, low technology, preventive measures and primary health care. In contrast, surgery and cancer treatment in general is perceived as a higher cost, higher technology, curative, individually focused intervention. Recent evidence however has documented the cost -effectiveness of essential surgical care in LMIC s, and the concept of surgery as a population -based, preventive strategy is slowly becoming acknowledged within the public health community. The proliferation of  virtual programs  in public health, many of which include effective surgical care, has made it difficult to develop a coordinating approach. The cross -cutting nature suggests that improved surgical care will strengthen health systems overall and enhance progress towards achieving the MDG s. In fact, the 2008 Copenhagen Consensus included surgery in its list of priority investments for the world s poor (6). Prominent public health ex pats have recently called attention to the longstanding neglect of surgery within global health and its crucial role in meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG s). At a first estimate, 11% of the global burden of disease can be treated with surgery (38% injuries, 19% malignancies ) - General objective:  Development objective: improvement of public health care.

khm2_2634,Rice Farmer Risk Management,RICE FARMER RISK MANAGEMENT,"Rice is Cambodia's primary agricultural crop, occupying over 70% of the total crop area. Despite significant technical advances and production increases, the rice industry is inefficient compared with world rice export leaders. This is largely because of a poor connection between the developers of recommended agricultural technologies and farmers: technologies are either inappropriate, or poorly packaged, or both, resulting in poor adoption. This small research activity aims to better understand why Cambodian rice farmers have not effectively adopted local best practice. It will evaluate processes currently used for agricultural extension, and consult with knowledge providers in government, non-government and commercial organisations. (ASEM/2012/070)",,

Also high concentrations of manganese, an essential element which is shown to be neurotoxic at higher doses, have been detected in infant food.  Specifically, we will i) estimate the exposure to the toxic metals through rice; ii) evaluate different biomarkers of manganese exposure; iii) evaluate associations of exposure biomarkers (in children with low arsenic and manganese in drinking water) with available data on child growth and development, including effects of combined exposure; and iv) assess the interactions with known susceptibility factors, such as nutrition, gender, and genetic predisposition.  The studies will be based on our ongoing large and well-characterized mother-child cohort (n=1500) in a poor area in rural Bangladesh. Because rice is the main staple food and the nutritional status varies markedly, this cohort provides unique possibilities to evaluate potential health effects of the toxic metals in rice on children and important susceptibility factors.  In this cohort, we have assessed child anthropometry and development (cognitive performance and behavior) at 1.5, 5 and 10 years of age in relation to elevated metals exposure through drinking water. The total exposure to arsenic, cadmium and manganese is based on available concentrations in biomarkers, such as concentrations in urine and blood, measured in the mothers during pregnancy and in the children at the different follow-ups. We also have detailed information on the concentrations in the drinking water used over time. In a sub-sample, we have also measured metals and other trace elements in rice (various types and degree of polishing).  The exposure to the metals through rice will be evaluated based on the i) estimated intake through rice, ii) the biomarker concentrations in the children with low concentrations in the drinking water and iii) the intercept of the biomarker concentrations regressed against the drinking water concentrations. As there is no known biomarker for manganese exposure, we will, in a sub-sample evaluate the relationship between various biomarkers (urine, blood, plasma, and hair), analyzed by modern ICP-MS in clean-room facilities, and also with the concentrations in water. All biomarker concentrations will also be compared with those in rice, measured in a sub-sample of the cohort. Evaluations will be gender-specific and consider nutritional status (anthropometry, SES and biomarker concentrations of selenium, zinc, and iodine), known to affect both absorption and toxicity. We will also evaluate impact of polymorphisms in genes related to kinetics of arsenic (main arsenic methyltransferase, AS3MT) and manganese (the solute carrier SLC30A10, coding",,

By 2020, it aims to transition 6 million low income/micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs) from informal to high-value, formal, and regulated financial servicew.  The total value of SHIFT  is $8.7 million over 3 years, starting 2013-14.  -     Mekong Business Initiative: The Mekong Business initiative (MBI) aims to promote Private Sector Development (PSD) in Mekong countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Burma, and Vietnam) by promoting business formalisation, financial market functioning and knowledge management and dissemination. This initiative focuses on poverty reduction by promoting economic growth through the private sector with funds provided through the Asian Development Bank (ADB) . The expected impact of the investment is that the private sector in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Burma and Vietnam, especially Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs), benefit from regional integration and create employment as measured by gender-disaggregated data on increased (i) number of new companies registered, and (ii) employment in the private sector, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total employment. The expected outcome is an improved business enabling environment in these countries. The total value of this multi-country investment is $13.0 million over 5 years, starting 2013-14.",,

SHIFT addresses the needs of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Middle-Income Countries (MICs) in emerging ASEAN markets, with a focus on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam (CLMV).SHIFT contributes to inclusive regional economic growth by supporting individuals on low incomes, particularly women, to use money more productively through increased access to products and services (i.e. credit, savings and insurance).  SHIFT supports challenge fund projects with private sector; data mapping of national financial inclusion - banking data analysis to improve client services; regional (ASEAN) and national policy / advocacy technical assistance; and learning activities - training banks to be more inclusive.By 2020, SHIFT in ASEAN aims to transition at least 6 million low income/micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs) from informal to formal, high-value, and regulated financial services.  DFAT's investment is directly contributing to increasing financial inclusion of low-income individuals and MSMEs by 300,000 (65% women) as an interim target by 2017.  This transition will enable individuals and businesses to increase productive investments and asset ownership, as well as strengthen capacity of national financial systems to capture domestic resources that can further contribute to economic prosperity.The total value of DFAT's funding to SHIFT is USD 6.9 million (approx. AUD 8.8 million) for over 3 years between 2014 - 2017.",,

The proposed S-PATA will: (i) advise the Government on improving the PPP policy, legal and regulatory enabling environment; (ii) strengthen public sector institutional capacity to develop and catalyze pilot PPPs; and (iii) help establish a Project Development Facility (PDF) to support the development by the Government of competitively-bid, bankable PPP pilot projects. The S-PATA is based on the findings of a joint PPP Assessment mission fielded by ADB and Agence FranÌüaise de DÌüveloppement (AFD) from 22-31 August 2011 to investigate the potential for PPPs in Cambodia. A.Impact and OutcomeThe impact of the S-PATA will be increased PPP to generate public infrastructure investments needed to accelerate Cambodia?s economic growth, and to enable the leveraging of limited public sector investments in infrastructure. The outcome will be an improved enabling environment to catalyze PPP infrastructure investments in sectors such as power, water, transport, education and health sectors. This environment needs to be underpinned by strengthened institutional capacity in the public sector to develop PPPs. B.Methodology, Key Activities and RisksThe S-PATA will provide rapid and responsive assistance to enable the Government to take a more proactive role implementing its PPP program, and manage associated risks. The S-PATA outputs will be delivered in a phased manner in accordance with defined milestones and provide the basis for generating greater PPP participation. The outputs of the S-PATA will be as follows: (i)Enhanced Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework The S-PATA will commission a strategic study for the Government on the preparation of a PPP policy, legal and regulatory framework, and outline institutional arrangements that reflects international standards and best practices. (ii)Institutional Arrangements for PPPs Refined and PPP Preparation Process Developed The S-PATA will review options and develop the basic outline of a model institutional structure that would reflect international best practice and meet the needs of Cambodia for the development and implementation of PPP projects. Effective institutional arrangements are one of the key factors that define a country's success implementing a PPP program. The two critical agencies that need to be developed by the Government are a PPP Unit and a Risk Management Unit (RMU).  A PPP Unit is a centralized agency that acts as a source and custodian of standardized PPP contractual structures and project screening, preparation, transaction, and management processes. The PPP Unit disseminates this information to prospective GCAs at the national and/or sub-national level considering the development of a PPP project, and provides technical assistance and oversight",,

IMF and World Bank have recently completed the first financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on Cambodia that will provide useful inputs to the update of the 10-year FSDS. While FSP I has been rated successful by the independent evaluation department (IED), some of the reform measures were not widely enforced due to weak interministerial coordination and capacity constraint. Prepared within the framework of the updated FSDS, the next program cluster (FSP III) will help complete some of the reform programs that commenced during FSP II, strengthen the enforcement of completed activities, and commence reform activities in leasing, capital market, and pension fund. The expected overall impact of the cluster program is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance mobilization of financial resources to support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome of the FSP III is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. FSP III was approved in November 2011.

After successfully rebuilding the basic foundation of the banking industry under the first and second programs,  the third program has begun to support the sector?s expansion to cover the important subsectors of nonbanking services and capital markets, and to boost investors? and beneficiaries? confidence in the system with a stronger legal and regulatory framework, necessary infrastructure, and better quality of services, including consumer protection.The third program has focused on creating an enabling environment for all sector stakeholders, including the various regulators. The scope has shifted from the establishment of regulatory frameworks to their effective implementation and oversight, and more transparency. Proper financial infrastructure is required to meet rising market needs for more efficient and diverse financial services, as is further development of the legal foundations to ensure smooth transactions in the sector. These reforms require coordination within the government and careful sequencing, including dialogue with the private sector. The third program has been facilitating closer coordination.After completion of the third program, ADB will continue the policy dialogue with the government under the Post-Program Partnership Framework. Also, ADB?s technical assistance (TA) for implementing subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program has been extended to June 2015 to deal with the remaining issues.6 However, for the next round of support, ADB should concentrate on its areas of comparative advantage, in consultation with other development partners and the government. A first dialogue with the government to this end has started in the process of formulating the CPS, sector assessment, and strategy and road map.The impact will be a sound, market-oriented finance sector that supports the mobilization of financial resources. The outcome will be a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system.",,

khm2_3153,Understanding digital access and use in the Global South,UNDERSTANDING DIGITAL ACCESS AND USE IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH,"As it increasingly becomes the infrastructure underlying all infrastructures and drives economic and social development, access to the Internet has become a priority for developing countries. According to a 2009 World Bank study, a 10% increase in broadband penetration generates a 1.4% increase in gross domestic product in low-income countries. Recent studies also revealed the household income of Internet users in several developing countries was 19% higher, on average, than non-users. The Internet is an increasingly essential tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, notably by creating an environment that spurs business growth, nurtures science and innovation, and empowers people.  Africa exemplifies the potential benefits as well the challenges of improving digital inclusion. While access to mobile telephony has risen tremendously, a new gap is emerging between those who have access to broadband Internet and those who do not. Recent studies found women accessed and used the Internet less than men, reflecting their uneven access to education and therefore income. In a context where public services and economic opportunities are increasingly moving online, access to high-speed broadband networks will be an enabler of sustainable livelihoods. Those without access to them, often women and the poor, risk further exclusion from these benefits. Public policies, informed by timely and accurate data, can contribute to an affordable and inclusive Internet infrastructure. To ensure that the benefits of broadband are more evenly distributed, such policies must take into account the needs and usage patterns of marginalized populations, particularly women and girls. Unfortunately, such timely and accurate data is not currently available in most developing countries. This project is implemented by Research ICT Africa, a South Africa-based network that conducts research on information and communication technology, policy, and regulation. Its aim is to facilitate evidence-based and informed policymaking for improved access, use, and application of ICTs for social development and economic growth. Working in collaboration with LirneAsia and Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, Research ICT Africa will collect nationally-representative data from household and individual surveys in fourteen countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This data will generate evidence on Internet access and usage issues facing users and non-users, particularly among marginalized communities, including women; promote evidence-informed policy change through strategic research communications; and build the capacity of Global South research leaders, enabling them to undertake rigorous policy research.",,
