La mayorÌ_a de beneficiarios habrÌÁn sido explotados sexualmente a cambio de dinero u otras formas de ayuda. Los menores suelen dar este dinero o bienes a sus familias, o bien lo emplean para pagar comida, refugio, drogas u otras necesidades. En muchos casos, miembros de la familia del niÌ±o vÌ_ctima de abuso estaban directamente implicados en el trÌÁfico de ese menor con fines sexuales. Beneficiarios indirectos: Las familias de los niÌ±os vÌ_ctimas de pederastia o en riesgo de serlo. Las familias en general cuentan con poco o ningÌ¼n recurso econÌ_mico, tienen bajo nivel educativo y en gran medida no son conscientes de los efectos perjudiciales de la prostituciÌ_n, el trÌÁfico y otras formas de explotaciÌ_n. Muchas personas no saben quÌ© considerar abuso y quÌ© no.

khm_3745,Road Improvement,,"Decades of civil strife have taken a toll on CambodiaÛªs infrastructure, particular the transportation network, a situation that is particularly acute in the impoverished northwest region. Two important national roads that pass through the area are the NR5 and NR6, which connect three major towns: Siem Reap and Sisophon, provincial capitals that provide linkages to the capital Phnom Penh and South Vietnam, and Poipet, a primary border crossing to Thailand. The stretches are presently in very poor condition and become easily flooded, and the associated bridges either need replacing or extensive repairs. The project will address these problems by widening and paving 150 km of the NR5 and NR6 with asphalt. Drainage structures will be installed, embankments raised to counteract flooding, and 45 bridges rehabilitated. Additionally, some 50 bridges along the Sisophon- SamrongÛÒKralanh route (NR56 and NR68), a region with enormous agricultural potential, will be reconstructed. Weigh stations will be built in high traffic areas in an effort to prevent excessive wear and tear. Once completed, the improved roads will help relieve the isolation of remote rural regions, and as the project area has a number of temples and other attractions, the countryÛªs tourism is expected to increase."

khm_1502,Continuum of Care,,"Summary: Cambodia continues to have the highest HIV prevalence in the Asia-Pacific region, with a national prevalence rate of 2.6 %, or 157,000 people, in year 2002. Using data from successive rounds of the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), it is estimated that HIV incidence has stabilized at approximately 7,300 new infections per year, 2,000 of which are in children. This stabilization of prevalence is supported by data from recent rounds of Behavioral Sentinel Surveillance (BSS), indicating a consistent decrease in risk behavior. Despite this stabilization in prevalence, the inexorable progression of HIV disease in the large number of people infected in the mid-1990s has resulted in a rapid increase in AIDS incidence. It is estimated that approximately 22,000 people will develop AIDS-related illnesses in 2005 and will require medical care and treatment with anti-retroviral (ARV or ART) therapy. While sex work largely determined the Cambodian epidemic in the early and mid 1990s, producing 90 % of new infections and 70 % in 1995, the success of condom promotion efforts for sex workers and clients has changed the modes of transmission. In the year 2002 almost one-half of new infections involved transmission between husband and wife and one-third from mother to child. Only 20 % of new infections were attributable to sex work. In 2005 the largest proportion is projected to be children infected by their mothers. These figures must be seen in the context of declining prevalence and incidence in all groups. This decline in HIV incidence contrasts with the increasing number of people infected with HIV who are sick and seek care. At the end of 2003, an estimated 2,301 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) were receiving ARVs; 24,243 more were in need of ARVs, but were unable to access them. The challenge for Cambodia now is to respond to an increased burden of care in the context of a developing health care delivery system, and moving rapidly to respond to the changing patterns of HIV transmission, particularly the rise of mother-to-child transmission. This proposal envisages the support of the Continuum of Care (CoC) framework and addresses the substantial gaps that exist in the delivery of ARVs to people affected by HIV. Through the Continuum of Care framework, care to PLHAs at the local level encompasses institutional, community, and home-based services that include clinical care, support and health promotion and education. The strategy emphasizes partnerships at local and national levels, strong coordination, functional referral networks, effective involvement of PLHAs, strengthening of health care facilities and expansion of ARV services as a key new focus of activity. By the end of the initial 2-year period of the Program, the key HIV care targets in this plan include the expansion of the CoC program to 26 Operational Districts, 9,170 patients on ARVs, 20,165 antenatal care clients in target facilities receiving Voluntary Counseling, Care and Testing (VCCT) with 425 infected pregnant women receiving a complete course of antiretroviral prophylaxis.

The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), in line with a recent joint donor evaluation of the sector, estimates that most of the negative socio-economic impact of landmines could be dealt with by clearing 427 square kilometers of high priority land over the next 10 to 15 years. RGC has requested donor assistance for this purpose, including inter alia the creation of a pooled funding mechanism targeting mine clearance resources on development priorities, as established by the Provincial Mine Action Committees and the Cambodian Mine Action Authority, in cooperation with concerned line ministries and development partners. This new multi-donor funding facility for mine clearance has been designed to address current efficiency and transparency issues, support a systematic integration of mine clearance with national and provincial development plans and programmes, and follow the principles of the åÒDeclaration by the Government of Cambodia and Donors on Harmonization and AlignmentåÓ, signed on 2 December 2004. The main project activities will include: establishing and operating a new demining fund that will include (1) a new approach to funding the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) that promotes a clearer focus on results and cost-efficiency and (2) the possibility of competitive bidding; developing and implementing a strategy for resource mobilization for the fund; building national capacities to provide independent quality assurance and dedicating the fundåÕs resources to national and provincial priorities established through a Government-led, decentralized, participatory planning process."

The two year program will reach 600 villages, 180 schools across 60 communes in 6 provinces. Background and Issues 3. ACWSI for Cambodia has been part of the draft Cambodia Australia Country Strategy Health objective. Greater hygiene awareness and access to improved sanitation contribute to reducing maternal and child mortality.Currently 20% of child deaths in Cambodia are from diarrhoeal diseases.Noting the crowded donor environment in the health sector the ACWSI will be implemented through UNICEF. 4. Since June 2008, AusAID and UNICEF have been planning a two year partnership to scale up the provincial and population coverage of UNICEFåÕs existing program which is strengthening the national capacity to achieve MDG 7c by increasing access to and sustainable use of improved water sources and sanitation facilities.Due to AusAID budget restrictions in 09/10 and potentially 10/11 the proposed partnership arrangement has been reduced to 18 months commencing in June 2009.UNICEF has confirmed that reduced duration and funding does not compromise the viability of the planned scale up."

In 2009 more than 150,000 cases of malaria were reported. But the true burden is likely to be much greater, as two-thirds of those who seek treatment for fevers do so in the unmonitored private sector. The overall goal of the program financed by this grant is to move toward pre-elimination of malaria across Cambodia, with special efforts to contain artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum malaria. Strategies include improving access to early diagnosis with the objective of detecting all malaria cases; improving access to artemisinin-based combination therapies in both the public and private sectors, so as to prevent use of monotherapies and substandard drugs; measures for vector control; implementation of an information, education and communication strategy to promote behavior change among the population at risk and mobilize the community to help eliminate the malaria vector. The program will also provide effective management (including information systems and surveillance) to enable rapid and high quality implementation of the pre-elimination strategy. The program targets village malaria workers, mobile populations, village health volunteers, pregnant women, provincial health departments, health centers and private facilities."

The component would support the following activities:i. Support to MAFFÛªs research centers (CARDI and the vegetable and rice seed stations) to improve foundation seed production and establishment of a certified seed registration and control system, with related institutional development enhancements;åÊii. Improved linkages and outreach between research and extension/advisory services to provide reliable updated information on CARDIÛªs productivity enhancing technologies, as well as with skills needed to more effectively demonstrate the benefits of that technology;iii. Development of a better system of GDAÛªs soil fertility analysis which would contribute to productivity improvement and be more responsive to the needs of extension workers at district level and supporting training of staff at all levels; andiv. Development of environmentally friendly Integrated Pest Management approaches that are responsive to local problems and establish participatory training methodologies to educate extension workers and farmers.Component 2: Community Investments for Agricultural Productivity.The component is expected to comprise the majority of the investments under the project. åÊIt would encourage farmer organizations at commune and village level to adopt yield improving technologies by increasing access to improved extension services and other service providers; and providing funds for the rehabilitation and construction of rural productive infrastructure, which would be identified by farmer organizations as key constraints to improvement of productivity and market access. To achieve these objectives, the project will provide resources to communes and villages based on the Commune Development Plans and Commune level AEAs. These investments would be subject to a negative list excluding social infrastructure (since these are already provided by other sources) and would need to meet preliminary screening for technical and financial feasibility. Such investments would also be subject, in the case of infrastructure, to technical/engineering supervision and final inspection/certification of the completed sub-projects. The selection process of the sub-projects will be clarified during the project preparation and specified in Operations Manual. The support to the communes could include inter-alia:åÊ(i) Provision of demand-driven advisory and knowledge extension services on improved farm management practices; crop and livestock production techniques; input use; marketing and market access, etc.;åÊ(ii) Promotion and adaptation of new technology packages through on-farm demonstration and awareness activities, including: identification/adaptation of improved seeds and crop varieties; safe and effective input use and sustainable improvement of soil fertility; improved livestock and fisheries technologies; new harvesting and post-harvesting technologies, and activities which would lead to improved marketing of produce; training farmers to select, clean and store seed from their own plots for replanting, etc; åÊ åÊ(iii) Rehabilitation of small-scale productive infrastructure (e.g. access roads and irrigation perimeters, storage and other post-harvest facilities, etc.);åÊ(iv) Support to district/village extension services and other service providers. This support would be directed to whatever services the communes and villages require. Support would be limited to the target project districts, commune and villages with support to central level as required to service those districts; and(v) Development of local groups of certified/commercial seed producers, working closely with vegetable and rice seed stations of CARDI and GDA, and facilitation of access to higher quality seed from foundation seed through qualified farmer associations. åÊ åÊComponent 3: Project Coordination and Management.åÊThis component would provide financing for the activities related to the overall coordination and management of the project to support work planning and budgeting, procurement, financial management, management of safeguards, internal and external auditing and the establishment of a rigorous monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system specifically designed for the project."

khm_2767,KH PECSA - The Asia Foundation,,"Grant Purpose:The main goal of the grant is to enable civil society practitioners to effectively promote and implement social accountability (SAc) approaches. In virtually all countries where governance deficiencies have been corrected, the impetus has come not just from reformers in government, but also from civil society organizations (CSOs), independent journalists, parliamentarians and citizens themselves. An array of tools and activities has evolved to maximize the effectiveness of these contributions - collectively called Social Accountability (SA) or the Demand-side of Good Governance. These tools have been well-honed in countries where they are widely practiced to become very powerful instruments. In Cambodia, however, there is extremely little experience with these tools or even awareness of them.The proposed program is designed to redress this gap by providing a menu of capacity-building, to support initiatives to help non-state actors learn about and pilot what has worked well elsewhere, to adapt tools to the local context, and to build up a community of SA practitioners that share experience, provide mutual support, and learn by evaluating unfolding experience.åÊGrant Activities:Component 1: Training, mentoring and awareness-raising.(1) Training in Social Accountability techniquesCenters of Social Accountability Excellence have been identified in countries where SA is widely practiced in India and the Philippines. These two partners will coordinate the provision by members of their networks of training modules tailored for Cambodian audiences (including NGOs, CSOs, media, academia, and government officials) and also training for Cambodian trainers.(2) On-the-job mentoring and coachingThis sub-component is similar to the above but with more intensive, task-oriented and on-going programs delivered within NGOs that are planning to use SA tools.(3) Exchange visits and scholarshipsThis sub-component will involve study tours with clearly defined outputs and follow-up plans to learn directly how specific SA tools are applied by leading practitioners, as well as scholarships enabling CSO leaders to gain a broader understanding of the discipline in countries where SA tools are extensively used.(4) Special programs linked to DFGG focus areas.Component 2: Tool Development and Action-Learning (Grant-making component)An independent non-state actor is being selected to implement this component (as a consultant), and a Grant-Making Committee is being recruited to decide on the grants. There will be two categories of grants:(1) Pilot Development Marketplace (DM)As CSOs acquire awareness about SA, they will wish to apply their learning by tailoring and innovating tools suitable for the country context. PECSA will support this through a competitive grant-making scheme that is being developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders. CSOs will be invited to submit proposals to a pilot DM for governance innovation.(2) Small Grants for tool-development and action research: There will also be opportunities for more modest grants to be approved by the GMC through the Small Grant mechanism, to provide support to civil society organizations to develop and test SA tools.Component 3: PECSA Leadership, Resource Centre and Network.(1) PECSA LeadershipA global leader in SA has been recruited to design, launch and execute the first phase of the program, ensuring that the best global experience and SA practitioners are drawn on.(2) Knowledge-management servicesA web-based and a physical resource base for SA practitioners are being established, including Khmer translations of the most influential SA literature.(3) Mutual support forumIt is anticipated to build the above function into a forum for SA practitioners to share experiences, learn from each other and solicit advice on tackling challenges especially targeted at all PECSA-supported practitioners.Component 4: Monitoring, Impact Evaluation and Learning.(1) Monitoring, Impact Evaluation and LearningSince Cambodia is low on the learning curve for SA, a key feature of PECSA is to ensure learning-by-doing.(2) Other Special StudiesThe PECSA Coordinator, in consultation with the emerging practitioners' network, would identify topics that warrant study in order to further SA practice in Cambodia.Component 5: Project Administration.The Component includes establishment of PECSA Coordination Unit and administration of the project. The program, being complex and with multiple components and sub-grants, needs careful administration and oversight by a specialized unit."

This project is focused on the first of these changes, addressing some of the common constraints to high productivity such as excessive weed infestation, uneven crop emergence and poor water control. This will be achieved through the increased capacity of machinery in both direct seeded rice and conservation tillage, also leading to timelier crop establishment, reduced weeding costs and better water management.

This network was severely damaged due to the military-led crackdown following the Saffron revolution in September 2007. The positive unforeseen impact of this support åÐ delivered between December 2007 and April 2008 åÐ was that it also gave DVB the means to cover the devastating impact of cyclone Nargis and the juntaåÕs National Convention Referendum in May 2008. As the junta goes ahead with its controversial and criticized åÒ7-step road map to disciplined democracyåÓ, there is another window of opportunity for DVB to use its citizen-focussed approach to democracy building: BurmaåÕs planned elections in 2010. As DVB is the primary source of independent information inside Burma, and the main provider of information on Burma to the outside world, it will have a key role to play reaching out to the population in Burma during what is expected to be a highly controlled and orchestrated electoral period. DVB needs to be able to inform the citizens of Burma about the competing political parties, their programmes and candidates, and to contribute to the formation of opinion of the electorate. For DVB do so effectively, it needs to prepare now. This project seeks to support DVB in its citizen-focussed approach to democracy building. A cornerstone of democracy is a knowledgeable citizenry. Therefore, the long-term objective of the project is to raise electoral awareness in Burma, and provide information to the international media on the BurmaåÕs elections. The expected outcomes are that DVB will have the tools and skills to inform the population inside Burma about what constitutes democratic elections as well as to cover the pre-electoral period, the elections and the post-electoral period in 2010. To do so, DVB requires support to expand its network of journalists inside Burma; to offer specialized training to its Burma-based journalists, including on subjects such as democratic elections and gender sensitive reporting; to produce and broadcast a series of educational programs on democratic elections; and to cover the elections."

The new project will continue the efforts of RETP in rural electrification, with two components: åÊ(i) rural electrification and (ii) technical assistance.The rural electrification component will include the installation of MV and LV lines along existing roads extending from existing EdC lines or substations. The MV lines will reach un-served rural villages, traversing existing REE areas in some of the cases. åÊOutside the REE areas, EdC will also install the LV network including the metering points to connect new rural households to ensure achievement of the project development objectives. The physical project will involve installation of concrete poles with all accessories, distribution transformers, conductors for the MV and LV lines, and meters. åÊIt is expected that some REEs close to EDC MV network will switch from their inefficient small diesels generators to EdCÛªs grid for bulk purchase of lower cost and better quality grid-supplied electricity. åÊThis will provide incentives to the REEs to invest in MV and LV line extension within their licensed zones to reach more customers since (i) the investment need in diesel generators to support such extension and associated risk of fuel cost fluctuation can be avoided, (ii) cheaper and more reliable grid-supplied electricity would promote consumption / demand growth, and (iii) the consumer tariff is regulated based on a cost-plus principle to ensure reasonable return on investment. åÊReplacement of expensive and inefficient small diesels generators will contribute to substantial reduction of the electricity tariff to rural consumers and to carbon emission reduction.åÊThe technical assistance (TA) component will support EdC in rural electrification through capacity building, studies, training and other technical assistance."

The White Paper on the Australian Governments Overseas Aid Program released in mid 2006, outlined a comprehensive approach to doubling Australia'a aid budget to aproximately AUD4 billion by 2010.This new policy directive identifies four themes for the aid program including increased support to social sectors.As a key theme of the White Paper, Investing in People prioritises health and education and outlines an approach to increased health assistance which focuses on basic services for women and children and on tackling major diseases such as HIV/AIDs and malaria. In response to the White Paper and an expected increase in bilateral funds in 07/08, the Cambodia Program undertook preliminary investigations to assess opportunities for future development assistance to the health sector in Cambodia.In October 2006, an Identification Mission was deployed to Cambodia."

Under the Program, the Principal Recipient is responsible for supervising and monitoring of HIV/AIDS implementation activities of approximately 11 sub-recipients including: Ministry of Defense Ministry of Social Affairs, Labour, Vocational Training and Youth Rehabilitation Cambodian Red Cross Youth Council of Cambodia National Centre for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Khmer HIV/AIDS NGO Alliance Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope Medicins du Monde Douleur Sans FrontiÌÄå¬res Pharmaciens Sans FrontiÌÄå¬res Population Services International Objectives: To slow down the spread of HIV infection among vulnerable populations; to extend the reach and improve the quality of sexually transmitted infections (STI) services; to provide care for and treatment to people with HIV/AIDS; to reduce vulnerability of selected populations at higher risk; and to make condoms readily available. The main activities of the program range through extending peer education programs to the military and the police and to newly identified populations at risk, including garment factory workers and youth; extending model STI case management in five provinces not yet fully covered by the national STI program; significantly expanding care and treatment programs for people living with HIV/AIDS, including limited antiretroviral therapy; extending impact mitigation programs in areas of heavy HIV prevalence; and extending the social marketing of condoms. Anticipated results: At the end of the program: * HIV prevalence rates will remain stable or decrease in direct and 'indirect' sex workers compared with HIV Sero Surveillance (HSS) 2000 data. * 90% of attendees at Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics will be diagnosed and treated following the specific protocol for the management of STIs in sex workers. * At least 85% of brothel-based sex workers will report consistent condom use at Behavioural Sentinel Surveillance (BSS). * Prevalence rates of Trichomonas infection will be less than 5% in regular attendees at STI clinics. * The number of condoms distributed annually will be increased by 20%. * 24 provinces to be covered by condom social marketing * Increase in centres offering HIV/AIDS counseling and prevention interventions for people living with HIV/AIDS and their families. * Increase in the number of centres providing care and treatment to people living with HIV/AIDS. * Increase in trained staff of government and nongovernmental organizations providing services. * 4,000 police and military in 4 provinces with improved capacity to prevent HIV/AIDS. * 15,000 community members in six communities surrounding military bases with increased capacity to prevent HIV infection. * Increase in the number of trained peer educators in garment factories."

There are three components to the project. The first is the Animal Health component. The objective of this component is to reduce and, eventually, eradicate the H5N1 virus from the poultry sector in Cambodia. This will reduce the risk of human infection with avian and human influenza (AHI) and protect the poultry sector and the livelihoods of many small-holders and poor farm households. Additionally, upgrading the animal health system will improve livestock sector productivity with benefits for commercial and backyard producers. The second is the Human Health Systems component. The component objective is to prevent the emergence of a human pandemic in Cambodia through the rapid identification and effective management of human cases. Strengthening public health systems will enhance national pandemic preparedness and help to reduce the loss of life that would result from a human pandemic caused by influenza. Finally; the third component is for the Inter-Ministerial cooperation for pandemic preparedness and overall project coordination, and management."

Cambodia is one of the 23 high tuberculosis (TB) burden countries in the world (source: World Health Organization (WHOÌâåÈ. TB remains an important countrywide problem affecting mostly the economically active population. Based on a WHO estimation in 1997, 64% of the population is infected with TB bacilli. Cambodia has the highest estimated incidence and notification rate among the high TB burden countries in the Western Pacific Region. According to the WHO Global Tuberculosis Control Report 2005 (year 2003 data), the estimated incidence of smear positive cases is 22511 00,000 population, the estimated incidence of all TB forms 5081100,000 population, the prevalence of all TB forms is 762/1 00,000, and the estimated TB mortality rate is 95/1 00,000 population. Based on the updated population figure, the estimated case detection rate (CDR) of smearpositive TB was 64% in 2004 (source: National Tuberculosis Program (NIP) Cambodia). The nationwide HIV sero-prevalence survey conducted in 2003 (source: The National Centre for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control (CENAT)), showed that 11.8% of all TB case were HIV positive. The estimated HIV prevalence in the adult population was 1.9% in 2004 (source: National Centre for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STD (NCHADS)). Planned Activities: Ì¢?å¢ Strengthen the technical and managerial capacity of health staff at all levels to deliver high quality DOTS services (capacity building); Ì¢?å¢ Ensure uninterrupted supply of drugs for TB treatment (sufficient drugs & lab supply); Ì¢?å¢ Strengthen and expand quality assurance ofTB microscopy to the entire TB laboratory network (Treatment: timely detected & quality treatment);  Ì¢?å¢ Update information on TB epidemic by conducting a National TB prevalence survey (Supportive environment, M&Eand operations research); Ì¢?å¢ Strengthen the community DOTS program through DOTS at village level; Ì¢?å¢ Increase access to DOTS among the urban poor; Ì¢?å¢ Strengthen collaboration between NTP&NAP at OD level; and Ì¢?å¢ Increase access ofTB patients to voluntary counseling and testing (VCCT) for HIV and relevant prevention and treatment programs (including antiretroviral treatment (ART) and care)."

Their services will be oriented to ''selling and supporting'' the small farmer on the development, production and marketing of high value crops (including improved rice varieties) facilitated by low cost drip irrigation systems and organic fertilizers. The project builds on a two year pilot with 450 farmers in an adjacent area, financed in part by the local CIDA Cambodia Fund.

khm_4000,"Strengthening Cambodia's Health System in the fight against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria",,"Background and Summary: In Cambodia, the fight against HIV/AIDS,TB and Malaria is being carried out in a context of severe resources constraints, a heavy disease burden, and serious post-conflict institutional challenges. A small informal economy and substantial social development needs mean that national resources available for the three diseases and the health sector in general will remain very limited for the foreseeable future. National health investment is supplemented by substantial international development assistance, however the total funding available remains well below recommended levels for achievement ofthe Millennium Development Goals. Cambodia's massive loss of educated people in the late 1970's and the disruptions imposed by ensuing years of armed conflict have seriously aggravated human resource constraints, particularly in keyage groups for strong management systems. Within such a context, it is essential that scarce financial, institutional and human resources be marshaled to maximize effectiveness of interventions against the three diseases and across the health sector. In the 1990s, the Government introduced health system reforms to improve and extend primary health care through the implementation of a district health system, which focuses on the distribution of facilities in accordance with a health coverage plan and the allocation of financial resources to provinces. Operational districts are composed of 100 000 to 200 000 people with a referral hospital providing a Comprehensive Package of Activities and health centers delivering primary health care to a target population of 10 000 through a Minimum Package of Activities. Sector-wide Management (SWM) is being pursued, which has most of the characteristics of a Sector Wide Approach (SWA), but excludes establishing a mandatory common fund basket and completely adopting common project implementation arrangements. In keeping with the Action Plan for Harmonization and Alignment of the Royal Government of Cambodia, the SWM mechanism should be a step towards a SWA. This would significantly increase opportunities for coordination of efforts and provide flexibility for the allocation of scarce resources. Government health expenditures have been increasing. In 1999, the approximate total Government expenditure on health was US$ 2.85 per capita, increasing to US$ 3.30 in 2003. Overall health sector financing in Cambodia absorbs approximately 10% of GDP, which is the highest among developing countries in Asia. An estimated 70% of health sector financing is from 'out-of-pocket' payments, representing approximately US$24 per capita, with donors paying approximately two thirds of the remainder.  There is a large and rapidly growing private health sector in Cambodia, however, few if any of the institutional prerequisites for efficient markets are in place. As a result, the private sector must be expected to remain uneven in terms of quality of care and equity of access and financing. The Cambodian health sector is seriously fragmented. The private sector is large and rapidly growing; however few if any of the institutional prerequisites for efficient markets are in place. The public health system is divided into numerous vertical national programs, including those focusing on HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, while at the operational level a highly diverse set of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) pursue goals at times parallel to, at times in competition with government priorities. Important economies of scale and of scope are thereby lost, transactions costs elevated, and additional bottlenecks created. The result is weakness of the health system as a whole, as well as unnecessarily high costs for the outcomes attained. Global Fund support has been invaluable in strengthening the national response to HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. These benefits have however also carried the cost of increasing the tendency to fragmentation through increased verticalization. Thus, while the national programs for the three diseases are strong, the health system necessary to support and sustain them is being weakened. However, if the Global Fund programs are better integrated with the core functions of the Ministry of Health (MoH), then the strengths developed within the Global Fund Principal Recipient and Sub-recipients can benefit the entire health sector, increasing the effectiveness of system-wide and cross-sectoral responses to the three diseases.  Planned Activities: Ì¢?å¢ Strengthen the functioning of the Technical Working Group for Health (TWGH) reviewing the current HSP phase 2006-2007 and contributing to the design of the HSP phase 20082010; Ì¢?å¢ Develop and implement TOWH peer review procedures for new sectoral contributions at central level; Ì¢?å¢ Throughout the MoH, including in Global Fund supported national programs; assess implementation of key operational planning, monitoring and evaluation processes, including AOP, JAPR and Mid-Year Review; Ì¢?å¢ Revise and refine mechanisms and processes, including program based budgeting and coding procedures and relevant Health Information Systems; Ì¢?å¢ Develop curriculum for and conduct annual professional development courses at central level for key provincial personnel, with focus on strengthening capacities for providing support to operational district levels; Ì¢?å¢ Provide regular technical support and mentoring to Operational Districts (00) through provincial level staff; Ì¢?å¢ Long term technical assistance (LTA) to strengthen the management of the procurement and distribution system; Ì¢?å¢ Review operating procedures for estimating and forecasting drugs, vaccines and medical supplies for national programs and the public health service; Ì¢?å¢ Align the procurement process used by the MoH with the procurement offices of the PR and the HSSP and at an appropriate time and with the agreement of all parties, assume responsibility for all drugs and medical supply procurement for the public health system; Ì¢?å¢ Develop a monitoring process that includes external agents from multi-lateral, bilateral organizations and civil society to implement procurement standards; Ì¢?å¢ Review and upgrade the preparation of supply and distribution instructions from the National Centre for HIV/AIDS, Dermatology and STD (NCHADS), the National Centre for Tuberculosis and leprosy Control (CENAT) and National Malaria Center; and  Ì¢?å¢ Ensure effective management of pharmacies at HC, RH and 00 through effective monitoring and reconciliation procedures."

While the project is technology neutral, for the purposes of project costing and subsidy calculations, it will be assumed that the service provider will choose to provide a basic voice telephony service using mobile technology. This is the predominant telecommunications infrastructure available in Cambodia and the mobile segment has significantly higher penetration rates than fixed lines and internet. The use of mobile technology will maximize the benefits obtained through the subsidy due to existing economies of scale.The second component is the basic access to services. The service provider must ensure that there are public access points which are accessible to residents in the target locations. Access points should be provided to 80 percent of the villages in the target locations.The third component is the additional services to be offered by service provider. The service provider must also offer additional services such as basic data and Internet access in their bid proposals.

This has resulted in reduced crop diversity, declining soil fertility and erosion. Expansion of cropping has coincided with a 20 per cent increase in the cost of farm labour since 2004 resulting in transition to tractors for cultivation and planting crops. Now only 5 per cent of cattle are used as draught animals compared to the national average of 28 per cent. Despite this, cattle numbers are increasing in the region-associated with increasing demand for beef. With an ample supply of crop residues and potential for production of forages, there are opportunities for profitable beef production from cattle in the region. This project will shift the focus from subsistence-based food security interventions to sustainable food security through diversification, generation of cash income and commercialisation.

Moreover, the project will assist the Government in formulating a long-term strategy, aimed at reducing the country's vulnerability to flooding. Nonetheless, potential risks include the occurrence of flooding during project implementation, therefore damaging project investments, and, weak implementation capacity, and delays due to slow procurement processes.

Years of strife and turmoil, rapid population growth, and agricultural development have led to a situation where most irrigated and flood-fed land is under cultivation. Land ownership is becoming increasingly skewed and landlessness is growing. In many cases rural labour mobility is an active choice, a diversification strategy based on (rural) labour availability and (urban) work opportunity that contributes to household income and wellbeing. However, there is increasing evidence that loss of land due to accumulated debt and illness forces entire households into distress migration.''A wide range of government and donor policies help shape migration. Nevertheless, migration is generally perceived as an independent phenomenon over which policy has little control. There is a need to assess government policies for their impact on migration and in turn, the incidence and severity of poverty.''This grant will allow researchers at the Royal University of Phnom Penh to examine the relationship between labour mobility and distress migration, and natural resource management. It will place the migration phenomenon in the context of cyclical household processes, community social capital, broad agrarian change, and government and donor policies. The research will explore how different forms of population mobility affect the management of agricultural land and other resources, where these are held by households or managed under externally promoted community-based arrangements."

When high food and agricultural input prices hit Cambodia in early 2008, it was clear that existing mechanisms were insufficient to support vulnerable consumers and farmers. These weaknesses garnered much greater attention by both the Government and development partners given the on-going effects of high food prices and as the impact of the global economic crisis are increasingly felt. The US$13 million Development Policy Operation (DPO) - consisting of a US$8 million grant from the Global Food Response Program and US$5 million in International Development Association (IDA) credits, is a stand-alone, single tranche operation intended to support key policy actions which strengthen the enabling environment for direct support poor households. It recognizes the actions taken by Government to stimulate a supply response amongst smallholder farmers, and to mitigate the impact on household food consumption among poor and vulnerable populations. The operation also supports medium-term efforts to improve social safety nets and agricultural production systems through better policies, strengthened institutional frameworks, and improved transparency and governance."

The transmission line component comprises the construction of a double circuit 220kV line from the border with Vietnam to Phnom Penh, and two associated substations; reinforcement of the grid around Phnom Penh, which involves lines and modifications to three substations and 22kV extension; establishment of a National Control Center to optimize load dispatch operations, and increase system security; and, building the Electricite du Cambodge (EdC) capacity in project management, land acquisition, resettlement and environmental monitoring and mitigation. The rural electrification component, supports EdC's grid extension program, covering medium, and low voltage lines and electrification for rural households. The Project will support the symbiotic relationship of EdC and the rural electricity enterprises (REEs), and whenever feasible, will make use of private sector providers in the operation of rural distribution systems. EdC would identify existing REEs, and options for public-private partnership, including distribution licensing, billing and collection arrangements, management contracts, and leasing arrangements. The pilot Rural Electrification Fund (REF) component, aims at implementing an innovative mini, and off-grid electrification program, as a transparent institutional mechanism for promoting rural electrification, established by the Government with administrative, managerial, technical and financial autonomy to channel sub-grants and technical assistance (TA) to the private sector, and rural communities. The REF will assist private sector developers in providing new connections, electricity to households using solar home systems, and add as well mini-hydro, and micro hydro capacity."

Production of livestock based food in the city is a good opportunity for them to generate incomes. But, there is an increased risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases from livestock to humans and the manure handling do posses an environmental/sanitary and public health risk as well. Usually, regulations for keeping livestock in cities lag behind in developing economies. In this project, to be performed in Phnom Penh in Cambodia, we combine social and veterinary science to analyse and balance the pros and cons for livestock in the city taking gender dynamics into account.

L'UNIVERSIT? DE M?DECINE DE PHNOM PENH,"The current project fits within a long-term vision on the reconstruction of the health care in Cambodia, that goes parallel with the development of the country. After the Khmer Rouge period and the Vietnamese occupation (1974-1994) medical care and medical infrastructure were totally inadequate in Cambodia. The Red Cross and AZG ( Medicines Without Frontiers) started with primary health care and set up first-aid hospitals. Meanwhile, AZG contacted a number of French, Belgian and Swiss universities to start up a new and adjusted medical training programme. UGent has taken up his role through a VLIR-UOS Own Initiative project in 1994, in which the objective was to train trainers in basic medical sciences and general surgery. As a result 6 PhD?s in surgery were realised. These doctors are currently in charge within the medical faculty of the local partner. Once the medical basic training was re-started, the focus was shifted to re-initiating the training of 2nd-line hospital doctors, taking on a thematic approach. UGent opted to focus on the second cause of cancer death in Cambodia: gastrointestinal cancer . A second Own Initiative was started in 2007 to get a better understanding of gastrointestinal tumours in Cambodia, which has lead to a better understanding of carcinoma in general and its treatment in Cambodia in particular. Currently, there is an increased awareness on the government level that they need a national cancer plan, in which the reference centre for gastrointestinal carcinoma plays a key role, in relation to both prevention and therapeutic treatment.Traditionally, public health in LMIC?s has focused on low cost, low technology, preventive measures and primary health care. In contrast, surgery and cancer treatment in general is perceived as a higher cost, higher technology, curative, individually focused intervention. Recent evidence however has documented the cost-effectiveness of essential surgical care in LMIC?s, and the concept of surgery as a population-based, preventive strategy is slowly becoming acknowledged within the public health community. The proliferation of ?virtual programs? in public health, many of which include effective surgical care, has made it difficult to develop a coordinating approach. The cross-cutting nature suggests that improved surgical care will strengthen health systems overall and enhance progress towards achieving the MDG?s. In fact, the 2008 Copenhagen Consensus included surgery in its list of priority investments for the world?s poor (6). Prominent public health ex pats have recently called attention to the longstanding neglect of surgery within global health and its crucial role in meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG?s). At a first estimate, 11% of the global burden of disease can be treated with surgery (38% injuries, 19% malignancies?) Development objective: improvement of public health care. The Cambodian society will benefit from an anticancer programme. This progra"

This stems from a lack of crop diversification beyond rice and a lack of nutrient rich foods in the diet. Though several intervention models are being implemented, there is a need to test integrated systems that increase and diversify food production, providing low income households with affordable foods with adequate energy, protein as well as bioavailable forms of essential micronutrients like iron and vitamin A. There is also a need for rigorous evaluation of the actual impact of agricultural interventions on nutritional status. This project led by the Helen Keller International, Cambodia and the University of British Columbia, Canada, aims to improve household food security and nutrition outcomes, livelihoods and women's empowerment through an integrated homestead food production which innovatively combines small-scale aquaculture. Research will be conducted through a randomized control trial using baseline and follow-up surveys to determine the impact of the intervention on household food security, nutritional status and livelihoods. The project will also assess income generating opportunities, issues around scalability and the feasibility of the model which will facilitate wider uptake in Cambodia and the region."

The state and non-state institutions and partnerships supported will be those that promote, mediate, respond to, or monitor to inform DFGG. The four priority reform areas, where DFGG approaches will be supported are those identified in the Governance Pillar of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), i.e., private sector development, management of natural resources, public financial management, and decentralization and citizens partnerships for better governance. The project has three components: (i) support to state institutions; (ii) support to non-state institutions; and (iii) coordination and learning. In component one, four state institutions will improve and scale up programs that promote, mediate, respond to, or monitor for DFGG in the priority reform areas of the CAS. In component two, non-state actors will develop their own programs in the priority reform areas. Some of these programs will be in partnership with the four state institutions supported in component one (funded through partnership grants); others will be independent of them (funded through thematic grants). The third component supports overall coordination of the project and promotes learning, awareness raising and capacity building on demand-side approaches."

HARVEST is developing agricultural solutions to address poor productivity, postharvest losses, food safety issues, lack of market access, environmental degradation and the effects of climate change on food vulnerable populations. The program focuses on household production, rural income diversification and value-chain strengthening. Improved land and other resource management will conserve and maintain the economic value of Cambodia s sensitive ecosystems and rich biodiversity, as well as reduce the vulnerability of agriculture and rural communities to climate change.

Although CambodiaÛªs economy is slowly recovering from 30 years of civil conflict, poverty levels remain high. Malnutrition is rife, with women and children representing the most vulnerable group within the countryÛªs population of 12 million. Many women are homeless and, lacking the skills or means to support themselves and their families, are unable to break the cycle of poverty. The Hagar Project, based in Phnom Penh, provides temporary homes for such women and their children, and offers vocational training in areas such as sewing, food preparation and soya milk production. It also creates small enterprises that offer poor women on-the-job training and employment opportunities. Since funding limitations have placed constraints on these programs, the Hagar Project is privatizing one of its enterprises, Hagar Soya, in order to reduce its dependency on donor contributions and insure the sustainability of its programs. With the help of the Fund grant, HagarÛªs existing soy milk production facility will be expanded, and a substantial portion of its profits channeled back into the Hagar ProjectÛªs social programs."

This may be due either to low reported incidence of tobacco-related disease or to lack of available treatment for anything other than infectious disease or trauma. Policymakers have expressed the need for convincing and reliable information on the health costs of smoking, particularly as a long-awaited draft tobacco-control law is due for Parliamentary approval.This project will attempt to identify sources of data and valid methods for estimating the direct and indirect financial costs of tobacco-related disease in Cambodia. The methods that are available to Cambodian researchers may be similar to those that have been validated in neighboring Laos and Viet Nam. This grant will support a meeting of Cambodian researchers, research partners with access to data, experienced researchers from Laos and Viet Nam, and an internationally renowned tobacco control economist, to design a suitable project.There is strong evidence from other countries that smoking increases the tuberculosis infection rate and reduces the tuberculosis survival rate. In countries like Cambodia, with both high rates of TB and smoking, the cost of tobacco use need to include the cost of tobacco-related excess TB. The Cambodian researchers will assess the feasibility of including this cost in their estimates."

Water supply and sewage disposal systems are inadequate; transportation and energy networks underdeveloped; and health care centers, schools, training facilities and even housing are in short supply. In recent years, agricultural production has declined sharply, partly as a result of frequent droughts and floods, and many people, especially in rural areas, have lost their livelihoods. At the same time, the population in these areas has increased dramatically with the return of refugees, soldiers and expatriate workers. This loan will help local government units, NGOs and rural community groups finance a number of small-scale sub-projects to build or repair vital infrastructure, including water supply and sanitation facilities, irrigation systems, roads, health clinics and schools. Priority in the selection of sub-projects will be given to those that are most likely to create employment for local inhabitants. The beneficiaries will be expected either to contribute 10% towards the cost of a sub-project or to participate in the design and supervision process. The project will benefit some 1.75 mil-lion displaced people by helping them become resettled and enabling them to begin rebuilding their lives."

INSTITUTIONELLE DES CENTRES DE R?HABILITATION PHYSIQUE DE SIEM REAP ET TAKEO,"Cambodia?s recent history of war has resulted in numerous internal problems. These include the breakdown of basic social and health services, the destruction of national infrastructure, the presence of millions of landmines throughout the country, and the absolute poverty of a significant part of its citizens. This in turn has left the country with a large number of vulnerable groups in society. As Cambodia is also amongst the world?s poorest countries, the recovery process is hampered by the developmental problems associated with extreme poverty.In this context, people with disabilities (PWD) suffer from a wide range of problems and form one of the most vulnerable groups. In a country where assets and income are constrained, most people are prompted to rely on physical labour to generate income. A reduced capacity to undertake physical work definitely limits disabled people's access to employment. Besides, care for people with disabilities limits the amount of time family members can spend on livelihood activities and increase the likelihood of poverty. Socially and economically isolated, PWD are extremely affected by the lack of social services, education, job or income generating opportunities and the increasing market competitiveness. Direct beneficiaries: Based on an estimated 13.38m population in 2008 , the kingdom could have as many as 630,000 PWD & 151,000 PWPD (mobility-related disabilities accounting for 24% according to CSES 2004), out of whom 18% (27,000) would live in the 4 provinces where the action will be implemented. Indirect beneficiaries: almost every beneficiary of the PRC will have dependents, or will be dependent on someone else. Through the provision of mobility means, developing ability to earn a living, adapting a house, sending a child to school, or receiving vocational training, the PRC will ensure that the family of a disabled person can benefit fully from his or her rehabilitation. The average size of households in Cambodia being estimated to 5.3 persons, 18,000 households? members (4,200 * (5.3-1)) will indirectly benefit the action per year. The overall objective of the action is to improve the quality of life of the people with physical disabilities (PWPD) in 4 provinces of Cambodia through the provision of diversified and sustainable physical rehabilitation services."

The transitory state of farming societies in these nations further amplifies their extreme vulnerability to climate change; it impacts on smallholder households to reduce the productivity of their farming systems. This project aims to develop strategies that enable policy makers to deliver more effective climate adaptation programs relevant to farmer livelihoods and food security.

The project has the following three components: Component 1) the proposed activity would support the ESSP 2004-08 Education Facilities Development Program providing lower secondary schools in communes without them, prioritizing communes with the highest poverty incidence levels. The provision of scholarships to poor children-especially poor girls and ethnic minority children-is an actionable measure under the NPRS to foster universal basic education and is operationalized in the ESSP 2004-08 under the Secondary Scholarships for the Poor Program. Component 2) will focus on strategic interventions around decentralized quality improvement in order to encourage right-age enrollment, foster promotion of students in lower primary, increase retention of students in upper primary, foster transition to lower secondary education and ultimately enhance student learning. Component 3) will address the implementation of additional selected interventions under the ESSP, to be agreed with IDA during project implementation."

The purpose is to improve food security and cash income for farm households to take them beyond their current level of marginal subsistence in selected districts of selected provinces. A major component of AQIP has been to expand farmer's access to high quality rice seed by establishing an independent, commercially viable rice seed operation, owned jointly by the provincial government and the provincial seed growers' associations. A private sector operating model was seen as integral to the success of this approach. The project is estimated at $20,748,540 over 10 years from 2000 to 2010. Since 2002, the AQIP Seed Company (ASC) has sold about 8,300 tons of rice seed. It is estimated that this had increased rural incomes by approximately USD14 million.Securing the viability of the ASC as an independent operation has not been easy as the legal frameworks governing company incorporation (sale of shares) and asset ownership (land ownership of the 4 Seed Centres) remain in progress. In addition, the operating environment has become more complex as the food, fuel and financial crises further constraint the compnay's operations. So, it is proposed that another 18 month-extension is required to carry out the exit strategy to enable the ASC to operate as a fully independent private company."

The programme aims to empower a local partner for independent community development work. FidaÛªs partner in Cambodia is Cambodia Global Action (CGA), an NGO owned by the Assemblies of God church of Cambodia (AOG). Fida and CGA work together in the local communities, which provide the partner with hands-on training in community development. The main approach used is that of Community Health Education (CHE). The programme has expanded to over 70 villages and will soon cover up to 130 villages altogether. Through the programme, the partnerÛªs capacities in community development grow and the organization will be able to carry out community development projects independently. In addition, CGA will be able to multiply the effect through training local churches on CHE. As a result communities all over Cambodia will be holistically changed."

The overarching goal of the program financed by this Round 9 grant is to contribute to strengthen the national health system through the identification and strengthening of complementarities between interventions for the three diseases and across the health system to achieve efficiency gains. The program also aims to increase demand for health services at the community level; reduce maternal and newborn mortality by increasing uptake of antenatal care and delivery and newborn care via linkages with the HIV and AIDS program; and improve the availability and quality of blood supply. The program will be implemented under sector-wide management (SWiM), which has most of the characteristics of a sector-wide approach (SWAp) but does not require a common funding basket or the complete adoption of common implementation arrangements. Sector-wide management significantly increases opportunities for coordination of efforts and provides flexibility for the allocation of scarce resources. The program targets the Department of Planning and Health Information, the Ministry of Health, the Department of Drugs and Food, the Provincial Health Department, national and local nongovernmental organizations, pregnant women, migrants and rural populations."

It will include the following two heavily inter-dependent sub-components namely capacity building at the system level and capacity building at the institutional (HEI) level.åÊ**Component 2**: *Competitive Research Grants*.The objective of this component is to improve the focus and quality of learning and teaching in public and private HEIs through the strengthening of research capabilities by:åÊåÊa) Reviewing and renewing curricula of post-graduate research methodology programs, improving the quality of workshops and of graduate seminars presenting research findings, and modernizing science laboratories for locally-based research;åÊb) Developing qualified research staff to increase the relatively low numbers now available, particularly in the key areas of science and math education, industrial technology, health, environment, and agriculture;åÊc) Developing, piloting, and establishing an efficient technically staffed Research Grants Commission for the allocation of public funds for HEI based research activities; andåÊd) Providing consultants to help establish and mount training programs in research methodologies and design in the key areas.åÊ**Component 3**: *Scholarships for the disadvantaged*. The objective of this component is to improve access to higher education through scholarships for academically qualified but otherwise disadvantaged students, including females, ethnic minorities, and students from rural areas. The component, as a way to build on and refine the current system of awarding scholarships, and focusing on priority areas in line with the Education Sector Support Project (ESSP), would:åÊa) Improve the management of existing selection and award mechanisms at DHE and both private and public institutional levels;åÊb) Coordinate donor support and increase the overall number of scholarships while rationalizing the proportions to be awarded across disciplines;åÊc) Allocate amounts for the various disciplines, taking board and accommodation, subsistence and learning materials expenses into account; andåÊd) Support the integration of data on scholarships with the overall Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) managed by DHE.Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.

La intervenciÌ_n se plantea en torno a varios ejes: - capacitaciÌ_n de los estamentos pÌ¼blicos en cuanto a la importancia de la participaciÌ_n pÌ¼blica para la mejora de la economÌ_a local y de la transparencia en la gestiÌ_n gubernamental, - refuerzo de organizaciones comunitarias como representantes de la poblaciÌ_n local y formalizaciÌ_n de estructuras organizativas de la sociedad civil a nivel de distrito para el diÌÁlogo con estamentos oficiales, - inclusiÌ_n de la perspectiva de gÌ©nero en todos los procesos de capacitaciÌ_n y planificaciÌ_n, propiciando una mayor y mejor participaciÌ_n de las mujeres en la toma de decisiones, - elaboraciÌ_n de planes de desarrollo de manera conjunta entre sociedad civil y autoridades, mejorados mediante la introducciÌ_n de demandas locales y objetivos de carÌÁcter econÌ_mico, - apoyo tÌ©cnico y financiero a propuestas socioeconÌ_micas derivadas de los planes estratÌ©gicos. Las organizaciones de la sociedad civil en ÌÁreas rurales camboyanas deben ser fortalecidas ya que carecen de la capacidad para constituirse como estructuras representativas para un diÌÁlogo efectivo con las instituciones oficiales. El trabajo a nivel de distrito viene apoyado por tratarse de un nivel institucional de cada vez mayor relevancia, responsable de planificaciÌ_n territorial a partir de 2011. Los beneficiarios directos del proyecto son las organizaciones de la sociedad civil y las instituciones pÌ¼blicas de nivel de comuna y distrito de los 4 distritos objetivo del proyecto, 2 en la provincia de Ratanakiri y 2 en Stung Treng, con particular atenciÌ_n a las mujeres y poblaciÌ_n indÌ_gena representadas en estos estamentos. La elaboraciÌ_n de planes distritales de desarrollo mejorados, con perspectiva de gÌ©nero, beneficiarÌÁ al conjunto de la poblaciÌ_n de los 4 distritos. En la actualidad, la FundaciÌ_n ETEA estÌÁ llevando a cabo un proyecto con una componente de apoyo a la participaciÌ_n pÌ¼blica en descentralizaciÌ_n en 2 distritos de Ratanakiri, cuyos resultados apoyarÌÁn y complementarÌÁn la intervenciÌ_n planteada en la presente propuesta. Para la implementaciÌ_n del proyecto se trabajarÌÁ con una ONG camboyana en colaboraciÌ_n con los departamentos provinciales de planificaciÌ_n y administraciÌ_n local, asÌ_ como con las autoridades distritales y asociaciones provinciales de consejos comunales de ambas provincias. Se establece ademÌÁs una estrecha colaboraciÌ_n con los diversos programas de Paz y Desarrollo en Camboya."

The CLRF will provide timely support to locally developed initiatives working in the land sector on land rights issues. The objective of the CLRF is to support the transparent and equitable implementation of the Land Law as well as other components of the legal framework in the land sector. These results will be achieved by putting in place a land rights fund that will respond to local initiatives that meet certain eligibility criteria. One of the objectives of this fund is to establish closer links between government planning, policy making and operationalizing units with civil society groups who are often advocating and working with community groups. The fund will attempt to foster a partnership by having representatives from both the government and civil society on the selection committee and also by supporting projects that bring together government and civil society representatives for discussions and dialogue at conferences, meetings and other fora. It is also CIDA's intention to hold an annual lessons-learned workshop with CLRF recipients, including government stakeholders, as well as our other land sector partners in order to facilitate knowledge sharing and a cross fertilization of experiences.Countries: Cambodia (100%) Sectors: 043040 (100%) Themes: Good Governance, Capacity Development"

khm_2765,KH Empowerment for the Poor in Siem Reap,Health and other social services (Other social services): 100,"Implementation of the Project shall follow four key principles:åÊ(a) a 'saturation approach' that reaches out to all of the poor within a single province - Siem Reap Province;åÊ(b) building upon existing initiatives, capacities and resources of the poor and the organizations that support them;åÊ(c) a customized approach that considers contextual differences; andåÊ(d) phased or sequenced implementation of the core strategy.åÊThe saturation approach is unique as this may be the first time in Cambodia that a development project has targeted an entire province. A concentrated effort on a single province allows build-up of a critical mass of organizations of the poor to create synergy and achieve maximum impact.   The Project has four principal components:åÊ(i) institution building,åÊ(ii) investment fund,åÊ(iii) support to link and scale-up pro-poor initiatives, andåÊ(iv) implementation support.   Institution Building Component.åÊåÊThis component will focus on:åÊ(a) developing and strengthening institutions of the poor; andåÊ(b) strengthening support organizations to provide the services needed by primary groups and federations of the poor.   Given the large number of community initiatives in Siem Reap, the Project will adopt a responsive, rather than a pro-active, approach, working with NGOs and CBOs and building upon existing organizations in the districts where these are concentrated. In the under-served, interior districts, however, a more pro-active approach may be required to establish, support and federate groups of the poor.   The initial focus of the Project will be to strengthen primary groups among the poor in the village, and federate them at higher levels (i.e., district, commune and province) to lower transaction costs and gain access to a larger pool of resources and greater economic opportunities.åÊFederation will also increase the likelihood of sustainability beyond the life of the Project.   Since members of savings and credit groups do not always share a common interest in an economic activity or the required skills set, they will require technical assistance in market analysis, business development, livelihoods support, etc. In fact, as the poor become more integrated into the market, their need for technical assistance may actually increase. The Project will promote service providers, which provide technical assistance, through a two-pronged approach:åÊ(i) providing resources to primary groups and federations to enable them to contract service providers, andåÊ(ii) investing in the latter to build their capacity and improve Page 4service quality. To identify fresh models for service delivery and up-scaling, the Project will organize Development Marketplaces and encourage competition among service providers.åÊInvestment Fund Component.åÊThe Investment Fund will have three sub-components:åÊåÊ1) Livelihoods-to finance livelihood needs, skills-building, business development, savings and credit facilities, investments in commodity and value chains, market access, links to agriculture research and extension agencies, and private sector partnerships. Apart from grants, financing will also be provided through other instruments - loans, guarantees, equity investments, etc. - where these are more appropriate.åÊåÊ2) Social Action-to enable the poor to access critical social services (such as adult literacy, health, advisory and legal services) and safety nets (e.g., micro-insurance and help-lines). Advocacy and information dissemination, including citizen action to resolve land disputes, will also be supported.åÊåÊ3) Pro-Poor Inclusion-to increase inclusion of the poorest and most vulnerable households. Experience suggests that the poorest of the poor may not participate in SHGs and special mechanisms will be required to reach them. The Project will identify the poorest households, facilitate their organization into SHGs, and provide SHGs with seed capital grants for lending to members and consumption-related expenditures. These SHGs will ultimately link to MFIs and other credit sources, once they develop a credit rating and meet graduation criteria.åÊåÊLinkages and Scaling-up Component.   This will have three sub-components:åÊåÊ1) Linking the poor to local engines of growth-to identify and promote market opportunities for small producers and the poor. As the experience in Siem Reap province shows, the poor do not gain from an economic driver (the tourist boom) without specific pro-poor approaches. A market intelligence survey will pinpoint economic activities having good potential and identify ways that the poor can take advantage of them. In interior districts, where there will be relatively less access to the tourism market, the Project may focus on land-based livelihoods and agricultural production.åÊåÊ2) Linking the poor to mainstream resource and financial institutions-to assist primary groups and federations to network with banks or microfinance institutions for investments to scale-up viable activities. Dialogue with MFIs in Siem Reap will be started as primary groups are strengthened and federations formed, and will emphasize access for the middle poor and the poorest.åÊåÊ3) Linking the poor to the local state -atwo-pronged approach will be employed:åÊ(i) an information and education campaign targeted at local government officials to inform them about the Project and solicit support, and åÊ(ii) facilitating citizen access to the local state to articulate Page 5concerns about community needs or resolve disputes and conflicts.åÊMechanisms for such collective action and aggregation of demand (e.g., the village network approach of GTZ) will be encouraged and supported.   Implementation Support.This will finance the incremental operating costs of the Project, including office infrastructure and recurrent costs, training, consultancies, establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems, studies and other technical services.   Provincial Livelihood Fund:An autonomous Provincial Livelihood Fund (PLF) will be established and housed in the office of the Provincial Governor of Siem Reap. The PLF shall have operational management autonomy in terms of staffing, funding, decision making and operating procedures. A Multi-Stakeholder Provincial Committee - chaired by the Provincial Governor and composed of representatives of provincial government departments, NGOs, civil society, and the private sector - shall perform oversight on the PLF. An independent grievance and oversight unit, reporting directly to the Committee, shall be established to receive, process and resolve issues and complaints about the Project."

The project helps small farmers increase their food security and make the transition from primarily subsistence agriculture to more market-oriented production. It delivers affordable agricultural technologies and agricultural and business services to smallholder farmers through farm business advisors (FBAs). FBAs are small entrepreneurs trained as agriculture extension officers. They offer services designed to support the development, production, and marketing of high-value crops (including improved rice varieties) facilitated by low-cost drip irrigation systems and organic fertilizers. The project builds on a two-year pilot with 450 farmers in an adjacent area. This project continues to document the model for future expansion on a national scale. It is aided by a contribution of $180,000 from DFID, as part of its support to ''research in use'' projects. This is the second component of a project valued at $499,663.

Cambodia has developed and is implementing the National Malaria Control Program to fight malaria with financing from the Cambodian government and various donors, including the Global Fund under the Round 2 Program (Grant Number CAM-202-G03-M-00). The overall goal of the National Malaria Control Program is to reduce malaria-related mortality among the general population in Cambodia by 50% and morbidity by 30%, within five years by the implementation of a comprehensive national malaria control strategy. The four main objectives of the National Malaria Control Program are: 1. To significantly increase community awareness and improve care-taking practices on malaria prevention and control with promotion of proper health seeking behaviour in endemic areas. 2. To improve access to preventive measures (nets and insecticide) through a community based approach. 3. To increase access to early diagnosis and treatment through a three-pronged approach (public, private and community-based). 4. To strengthen the institutional capacity of the national program at all levels. This Program will provide additional support to achieve the first two of the objectives listed above and will complement the Round 2 Program by supporting on-going program activities. In particular, this Program will: Ì¢?å¢ Build on and further strengthen the decentralization policy of the government of Cambodia currently being pursued across all sectors, including the health sector, with communities being involved in informed decision-making and actively participating in preventive and promotional actions directed against malaria. Ì¢?å¢ Scale-up the piloted approaches such as introduction of women change agent educators, participatory theatre, malaria school health education and child-to-child approach as well as social marketing of insecticide treatment kits (ITK) for hammock and bed nets in a phased manner. Ì¢?å¢ Fill existing gaps in the National Malaria Control Program, especially by expanding the coverage of behaviour change communications (BCe) approaches and providing free distribution of long lasting insecticide mosquito nets (LLIMN) in remote and rural areas and islands. This Program will be implemented by the same 4 Sub-recipients as the Round 2 Program in collaboration with a number of other implementing partners. Planned Activities: Ì¢?å¢ Strengthening support to BCC approaches nationwide (aimed at establishing a standardized, comprehensive and effective BCC strategy). Ì¢?å¢ Distribution ofLLIMNs in remote and inaccessible areas. Ì¢?å¢ Social marketing of ITKs for nets aimed at reinforcing the vector control measures (to reduce the transmission of malaria and the burden of disease in Cambodia)."

Slow economic growth and high commodity prices have intensified food security and poverty reduction concerns in Cambodia. CAVAC aims to achieve accelerated growth in the value of ag production and smallholder income initially focussing on rice, fruit and vegetable in the rice based farming systems of 3 selected provinces (Kampong Thom, Kampot and Takeo). The A$48 million program has been designed to address key systemic failures along the agriculture value chain from supplier to consumer.To enable higher productivity and incomes, CAVAC will strengthen market connections that promote greater investment and add value along specific product value chains that link suppliers to farmers and farmers to consumers. Key stakeholders include Min of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Min of Water Resources & Meteorology(MOWRAM), CARDI, Provincial Administrations, Private sector and other Dev't Partners in the ag sector. The program design started in March 2007 with the implementation of interim activities from Sept 2007 to June 2009 to document lessons learnt and to scale up these activities in the next full implementation phase. The full implmentation will commence in third quarter 2009. and complete in June 2014. The Program has 4 main delivery components that are designed to be implemented in a coordinated, mutually reinforcing manner: 1. Agribusiness Development: Strengthened agribusiness activity results in increased smallholder farmer income. 2. Water Management & Irrigation: Sustainable increase in the area and yield of irrigated crops. 3. Research & Extension: Research and extension activities alleviate key value chain constraints. 4. Business Enabling Environment: Improved regulatory and investment framework results in increased agribusiness investment."

The current phase of support through the Cambodia Criminal Justice Assistance Project (CCJAP) Phase 3 will finish in February 2012. AustraliaÛªs Strategic Approach to Aid in Cambodia 2010-15 includes a continued focus on the justice sector as a strategic priority for AustraliaÛªs development assistance. Through three sequential CCJAP iterations, AusAID has evolved its development assistance from being largely donor driven and exclusively institutionally focused to an increasingly community oriented and locally owned and administered program of support to provide communities with equitable access to justice. The Australian Aid Objectives (AAO) for the next phase of support have been agreed between the two Governments in the Joint Statement of Commitments. The AAOs have been determined on the basis of lessons learnt from fourteen years of engagement in the sector, the analysis from the CCJAP3 Mid Term Review of early 2010, confirmed by a combined review/evaluation conducted by AusAIDÛªs Office for Development Effectiveness (ODE) Law and Justice evaluation and a subsequent Theory of Change analysis involving AusAID and stakeholders."

More than 40% of children below five years of age in the project area suffer from malnutrition. It is estimated that, at full development, 49 600 poor households, or 26% of the rural population, will benefit directly from project assistance.The project will improve household nutrition and food security and have a positive impact on women by enhancing their role as agents of change in the process of social and economic development. Innovative features:The innovative features of the project include the following: (i) first multisector rural development project financed by IFAD in Cambodia; (ii) introduction of sustainable arrangements for full beneficiary responsibility for operation and maintenance of the infrastructure investments; (iii) provision of direct support and empowerment of grass-roots organizations; (iv) enhancement of accountable governance through transparent staff selection processes and contracting arrangements for the implementation of all project activities; (v) institutionalization of project impact assessment and beneficiary monitoring directly linked to the objectives and outputs of the logframe; (vi) promotion of gender mainstreaming and awareness among communities and project staff, and promotion of family agreements between women and other family members to ensure womenÛªs participation in the project and in decision-making; (vii) a project implementation manual; (viii) provision of institutional support to the decentralization process and structure, not only for this project but also for coordination of all rural development programmes in the project area; and (ix) a participatory land-registration process."

A major component of AQIP has been to expand farmer's access to high quality rice seed by establishing an independent, commercially viable rice seed operation, owned jointly by the provincial government and the provincial seed growers' associations. A private sector operating model was seen as integral to the success of this approach. The project is estimated at $20,748,540 over 10 years from 2000 to 2010. Since 2002, the AQIP Seed Company (ASC) has sold about 8,300 tons of rice seed. It is estimated that this had increased rural incomes by approximately USD14 million. Securing the viability of the ASC as an independent operation has not been easy as the legal frameworks governing company incorporation (sale of shares) and asset ownership (land ownership of the 4 Seed Centres) remain in progress. In addition, the operating environment has become more complex as the food, fuel and financial crises further constraint the compnay's operations. So, it is proposed that another 18 month-extension is required to carry out the exit strategy to enable the ASC to operate as a fully independent private company."

In September 2007, IDRC convened its first-ever all-partners meeting in Cambodia under project 104516. The meeting involved over 80 participants, including three Cambodian ministers and all IDRC research partners. Three clear recommendations emerged from the all-partners meeting. These called for a development research forum, an accelerated information and communication technology (ICT) platform, and more opportunities for researchers at the graduate and postgraduate level.''This grant will support the establishment of an issues-based Cambodia Development Research Forum and a network platform for development researchers. The Forum will hold one major event per year similar to the all-partners meeting, with small events on themes suggested by partners held throughout the year. It will also administer a small grants and research fellowships fund, and support the translation of key theoretical and empirical research documents from English to Khmer. An accelerated ICT platform will be put in place to help the research community manage information and communicate with one another, as well as the broader development community.''In Cambodia much of the capacity for development research currently resides outside the universities. The Forum will therefore commission a scoping study to explore the constraints and opportunities involved in research capacity building in tertiary institutions. In the meantime, it will endeavor to enhance existing tertiary networking, and make available a small pool of funds for research internships and graduate student mentoring. It is hoped that over time the Forum will lay the groundwork for a national research council of Cambodia."

khm_1096,Cambodia Innovative Interventions,CAMBODIA INNOVATIVE INTERVENTIONS,"Cambodia Innovative Interventions The project takes place in 5 villages of Cambodia's Pursat Province and seeks to improve the lives of poor rural populations through a series of innovative interventions in agriculture, health, environment; and community organization and education through 'self help groups'. In agriculture, this will be achieved through the establishment of cow banks and a 'dry season rice seed' bank. The project will also introduce technologies for increased family well-being - composting pit latrines, bio-sand water filters and solar lamps. Management committees composed of elected beneficiaries will be established to oversee the project activities and their continuation upon project completion. Training sessions will be delivered to 1200 families on human rights, organization, management, health, hygiene, water, sanitation and the environment at home and in the village. Improved rural living conditions through mutually beneficial innovative technologies (in areas of microcredit, food security, health, sanitation and safety, environment, and gender) and the capacity to sustain and expand the benefits of this holistic and innovative development.Expected Outcomes: 1. Rural families previously excluded from traditional micro-credit institutions access in-kind credit, increasing income generating activity and farming efficiency 2. Local food security and incomes increased, debt and dry season migration reduced as rural families access affordable, alternative, rice crop technology and the benefits of year-round crop production 3. The spread of diseases related to poor sanitation (diarrhea and worms) is reduced through education 4. Improved health of neglected communities through access to clean, disease-free water 5. Rural households will benefit directly from increased health and safety, literacy and environmental sustainability by reducing the use of kerosene, car batteries and diesel through the introduction of solar lighting. 6. Net improvement of local environment due to decreased pollution and degradation Improvement of daily conditions for women and their families as target beneficiaries in villagesExpected Outputs: - 90 families gain ownership of a cow or buffalo for agricultural and household use , having an approximate value of $300 - 80 families increase their farm land production and secure access to income and food year-round - 3200 families construct and use composting latrines - 200 families educated about disease pathways and the safety risks associated with open defecation, and the practice of good hygiene and sanitation - Safe use of composted human excreta as natural fertilizer for home gardens and rice fields - 300 families are properly using and maintaining bio-sand filters - 300 families are properly using and maintaining solar powered lamps and energy systems - Innovations provide alternatives to activities that otherwise cause environmental degradation and pollution - Women strategically involved and pa"

Innovations such as genetically engineered (GE) crops can increase food production and minimize (or totally obviate) the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides. But many Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR, have yet to develop the regulations, institutional mechanisms and organizational structures necessary for the deployment of these crops. Other countries, such as the Philippines, have regulatory policies in place but have yet to carry out an in-depth analysis of compliance.This grant will support a two-year project to examine the institutions (such as regulatory policies) and actors (departments of agriculture, local government units, seed companies, etc.) involved in the deployment of GE crops in the first three countries mentioned above. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, where GE crops have not been released, the study will use an ex-ante analysis to assess their potential socioeconomic impact and policy implications. Building on an earlier project (103577), the Philippines component will involve an in-depth ex-post analysis of the socioeconomic impacts of three different GE corn varieties (Bt, stacked genes and herbicide-tolerant) already under cultivation in the country.The idea is to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of GE crops by strengthening the institutions and organizations involved in their adoption, thereby contributing to food security and poverty alleviation. The project will also help build the capacity of research partners, including junior researchers, graduate students and policymakers, in the countries involved."

This strategy highlights that a more strategic and targeted focus is needed in areas where progress has been slow and that the highest levels of expenditure will be in the countries with the most severe gender gaps. Cambodia meets this criterion as it ranks 99 out of 145 countries in the Gender Inequality Index (GII) of the 2011 Human Development Report (HDR), which is one of the lowest rankings in the region. The program will work with the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MOWA) of the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), the Ministries of Interior and Justice (through CCJAP) and Cambodian Civil Society to deliver a comprehensive response to VAW. In the short term, we will: support the development of a new National Action Plan on Violence Against Women (NAPVAW) that is fully costed, evidence based, and developed in consultation with communities, survivors of violence, Civil Society Organisations (CSO) and whole of government, to identify a comprehensive and coordinated response to VAW; and b) support a prevalence study that will ensure resources are well targeted need. In the medium term (July-December) the program will undertake a joint design with UN Women to: 1) identify the best modality for civil society support for providing victim assistance services, legal aid, advocacy and community awareness/behaviour change; and 2) assess the feasibility of integrating the legal enforcement aspects of the NAPVAW into the new phase of assistance to the justice sector); andlonger term we will have: i) an Agreement with UN Women to manage a civil society program window; and ii) integrated feasible components of NAPVAW into the 2013 CCJAP Annual Plans, leveraging additional funding to make real improvements.

In response to the White Paper and an expected increase in bilateral funds in 07/08, the Cambodia Program undertook preliminary investigations to assess opportunities for future development assistance to the health sector in Cambodia.In October 2006, an Identification Mission was deployed to Cambodia."

The project aims to provide village leaders and community members with the tools and knowledge required to create development plans for their villages. In support of stronger, more prosperous communities, development plans: 1) help the villages to shape a vision for the future, 2) prioritize community problems, 3) plan and implement sustainable and locally-owned development, 4) monitor and evaluate results, and 5) mobilize local and non-local resources. All project activities are under the control of the local communities and reflect their needs. The project emphasizes enabling local human resources to accomplish local objectives. Village-level committees are established, composed of volunteers trained to teach agriculture and health sessions to neighbouring families. Agricultural topics include integrated pest management, green manure, single seedling technique, and drip irrigation. Health topics include improved nutritional, hygiene, and disease prevention behaviours.

It is one of the poorest countries in Asia. 62% of the land mass is covered by forest and jungle, which is ideal place for breeding of malaria vectors. 2 million people are at risk and 500,000 are living in the high transmission forest. The main groups affected by malaria include ethnic minorities, forest fringe inhabitants, temporary migrants and new forest settlers.  Malaria is one of the leading public health problems. It is ranked the 3rd most common cause of out patient attendance (4.6%), the leading cause of hospital admissions (13.7%) and hospital deaths(16%).  Cambodia is running pilot projects for dipstick diagnosis and treatment of pre-packaged anti-malarial combinations, distributions and re-treatment of insecticide treated nets in some of the high risks areas. Lack of resource has prevented the intervention going to scale.  Goal to reduce malaria related mortality by 50% and morbidity by 30% in general population within 5 years.

khm_2887,Local Governance and Development Program,,"11. Proposed Project Components: The SNDD-RP would provide (through a SIL) support over three years (2011ÛÒ2014) through the following 4 components (3 plus management support):åÊComponent 1: åÊCommune /Sangkat åÊand District Grants åÊ (Sub-component 1a and 1b: US$ 20.0m; Sub-Component 1c : US$8-10m(TBC))åÊ12. Since 2003, the Commune Sangkat Fund has provided an annual basic infrastructure and services grant to each of the 1,621 communes for selected investments within their jurisdictions, and the Commune/Sangkat Councils have had decision-making powers over the use of the funds within the parameters established through prescribed planning processes. åÊThe allocation to the C/S Fund from recurrent revenues has increased each year, and will be 2.80 percent of public sector revenue (or an estimated $15,000 per commune) in 2010. åÊ13. The 3 year Implementation Plan plans for the development and refinement of the Commune Sangkat Fund to further distinguish between (i) the general mandate of the Commune Council and its executive administration, and (ii) capital investment. åÊRGC support is envisaged to the discretionary window of the CSF and the SNDD-RP is accordingly being structured to reflect the differing function and use of those grants. åÊThe proposed commune and sangkat grants will continue with the previous governance and development objectives: (i) provide grants for investments selected by commune councils through agreed participatory planning and budgeting processes; and (ii) contribute to a process of developing effective intergovernmental fiscal transfers to local government through the Commune/Sangkat Fund. åÊThe funds will also support (iii) the development of commune capacity for basic public administration and public finance functions in the use of grants, and (iv) the ongoing development of Commune/Sangkat Councils as elected decision-making bodies engaging in participatory governance mechanisms. åÊSub-component 1a: Commune/Sangkat Investment GrantsåÊ14. The 3 yr Implementation Plan sets out the rationale for a Local Investment Grant (LIG) facility in the CSF which continues to enable Communes and Sangkats to plan, budget for and implement priority small-scale investment projects. åÊIn addition to the empowerment, systems and capacity building objectives mentioned above, these local investment grants will contribute directly to local development objectives. åÊGiven the experience of Commune Councils in planning and managing the CSF for small commune infrastructure projects such as roads and drainage schemes, these investment grants would be provided from Year 1 and would, with some refinement, provide a continuation of the RILGP funding. åÊThis commitment would also help to leverage an increase in C/S Fund allocations by both the RGC and sector DPs. åÊDepending on the rate of growth of funding from the RGC Budget, and the buy-in of DPs, this could increase from the current average investment funding of about $24,000 per commune in 2010, to $30,000 or more per commune by 2013.åÊSub-component 1b: Commune/Sangkat Operational Grants15. In the 3 yr IP, the autonomy of commune councils is to be enhanced by providing a separate grant mechanism within the CSF for discretionary funding to communes to encourage decision-making around non-infrastructure activity. åÊThis marks a departure from the previous working of the CSF which saw almost 70% of expenditure funding one or two projects in each Council area annually ÛÒ mostly roads. åÊCouncil decision-making will now be empowered by providing Commune and Sangkat councils with the funds to direct resources to recurrent or other capital costs that meet local needs. åÊThe activities that commune councils are likely to focus on vary substantially, but are likely to include: åÊthe recurrent costs for supporting services (e.g. Agriculture extension workers / water attendants, social protection and social justice activities, as well as the overheads of the councils etc. (currently around 20% of the annual budget).åÊ16. Given the need to establish procedures and accountability mechanisms, this sub-component would not disburse IDA funds in Year 1 of the project (the proposal would be for RGC and DPs to support in Year 1). However once selected fiduciary indicators were met (e.g. on financial management and control capacities), IDA funds would be made available to promote the principle ÛÏlocal decisions meet local needsÛ. For Bank support to be triggered and maintained, we would expect to see a number of governance indicators measure the capacity, accountability and responsiveness of the commune councils and executive. åÊSub-component 1c: District-level GrantsåÊ17. The funding of under-resourced districts has long been on the radar of the Bank, yet to date there is still a lack of clarity around the decision-making roles of District/Municipal/Khan Council, the functions to be assigned to the district level, and no clear agreement in RGC as to the financing mechanisms (be they for investment or discretionary purposes) of the District. A decision on this is now anticipated later in 2010 when the Implementation Plan is discussed within the RGC and with funding DPs.åÊ18. Once in place, the project would support RGC efforts to further establish Sub-national Government financing mechanisms and support proposed grants to the district level, and capacity building and resources for joint programming (District with Communes/Sangkats) within the parameters of assigned functional responsibilities. While more certainty is needed on the fiscal transfer system and the functions of the District-level Councils before it is possible to propose a level of support, the IP3 does describe both investment and discretionary grants to the district, which could be supported:åÊÛ¢ For investments, funding would be tantamount to extending the previous RILGP Commune/Sangkat Fund funding for infrastructure projects into a newly operationalized tier of local government. åÊ It is likely that they will result in higher value investments in similar types of projects to those currently funded by the Communes (and we have therefore noted the possibility of additional safeguards issues), but could also involve the purchase of good and equipment. åÊIndications in the IP3 are that average funding for Districts would be higher than for Communes under sub-component 1a.Û¢ In line with the RGC intention to establish a discretionary funding mechanism for the Communes, there are also plans to provide District Councils with similar funding. åÊThe IP3 indicates that the average level of this funding might be more than twice the size of the discretionary grant per Commune. åÊThe team suggests that IDA funds should not be planned for in the first year and any contributions thereafter would depend on Districts meeting minimum standards of fiscal and financial management (ensured through capacity development and TA) and on the level of support from other DPs.åÊ19. The principles and anticipated trends on funding to all the grants described above are currently under consideration by the RGC. Scenarios for different levels of funding for the commune and district grant Components are provided in Annex 3.åÊComponent 2: åÊStrengthening Local Government Financial Management (US$ 5 million)20. The IP3 envisages a range of sub-national financial management activities which support key MEF and NCDD-S steps in the process of establishing sound and transparent sub-national financial management practices. This would include, as directed by the Fiscal and Financial Affairs Sub-Committee of NCDD and defined in the IP3, support for the development of the policy and legal framework, and the instruments and institutional capacity for implementation. Two areas of activity are envisaged, and described in the IP3. åÊThey would supplement the work currently programmed by the PFMRP.åÊSub component 2a: åÊ Policy, Legislative and Procedural Framework for Local Government Finance21. Support under this sub-component will include the incremental development of the fiscal decentralization system through: (a) ongoing support for the development of policy, legal and regulatory frameworks (on own source revenue, fiscal transfer systems for investment and operational grants, fund flows to district etc) to get resources to the local government levels; (b) the revision and/or development of the legal, regulatory and procedural framework under which for the investment and operational grant windows can operate: and (c) the development of legal, regulatory and procedural documents under which local government is to manage its finances. åÊSub-component 2b: åÊInstitutional and Capacity Building Support for Local Government FinanceåÊ22. Institutional Capacity Building (ICB) support for local governments to perform their decision-making and financial management functions is envisaged in relation to: staff capacity, treasury functions, supervisory and monitoring roles for fiscal and financial management. åÊSupport will be provided as necessary in core ministries (MEF and MOI) at the national level as well as the district and commune levels. åÊAt the local level, ICB may include TA in the development of elected Council, senior staff and finance officersÛª skills. It would include the development of transparent financial management practices in Districts and Communes, including planning/budgeting relationships, budget implementation, cash-management, procurement and contract management, book-keeping, financial reporting and auditing. Activities would aim to minimize the defacto practice of substitution TA (at the National Level) and aim at creating effective and sustainable administrations through the sustained implementation of HR and PAR strategies (including capacity building and other dimensions of PAR) that gives skills and responsibilities to local employees.åÊComponent 3: åÊStrengthening Accountability and Oversight (US$ 4 million)23. Supporting the grants element of the SNDD-SP, the project envisages a set of cross-cutting activities focused on building the commitment and capacity for vertical and horizontal accountabilities defined in the IP3 (SNA Organization/Resources). This includes providing support to the commune and district Councils, but also to key institutions at the national and provincial levels to build capacity in their new roles as overseers and regulators for enhanced accountability, transparency and anti-corruption. It is envisaged that this operation will embody a range of anti-corruption instruments to establish a sound anti-corruption platform. åÊ This component is structured around three sub-components: (a) oversight capacity building activities, (b) local government accountability activities, and (c) local (non-state) social accountability and citizen empowerment activities.åÊÛÄSub-component 3a: Strengthening Oversight24. Support under the Oversight sub-component will focus on developing the national and provincial oversight framework envisaged by the IP ÛÒ including the definition of roles and relationships, and the capacity of key oversight institutions necessary to promote and ensure effective sub-national performance. åÊThis might include support for national and sub-national auditing agents/institutions and processes, provincial anti-corruption units (envisaged under the Anti-Corruption Law) as well as the redefined roles of national D&D institutions such as the NCDD and the District Ombudsman. åÊThe entire system of sub-national accountability is dependent on the effective transition of higher level administrations from acting as ÛÏproviderÛ to ÛÏoverseer and regulatorÛ for which there needs to be clarity of roles and corresponding capacity building.åÊSub-component 3b: åÊStrengthening Local Transparency and AccountabilityåÊ25. Support under the Local Government Transparency and Accountability sub-component will focus on developing institutional aspects of accountability at the commune and district levels, as envisaged in the IP3. åÊThe set of activities critical to the development of local governance and effective local development decision-making includes (a) the strengthening of systems and capacity of commune councils (including the capacity building towards the refinement and development of the planning and budgeting process, designing and launching social audit processes, enhancing women councilorsÛª voice etc), and (b) the transparency and capacity of the administrations that support them (including transparency of budgets etc). This sub-program would also support the development of complaints mechanisms proposed in the districts, possibly in line with the longer-term roll out of the District Ombudsman currently piloted by DFGG.åÊSub-component 3c: Citizen Empowerment and Social Accountability (no IDA, possible MDTF)26. The objectives of decentralization and the development of local government accountability systems, including the efficacy of elected officials, is ineffective without building demand-side pressure from citizens. åÊA third accountability sub-component would provide direct support to underpin and strengthen civil societyÛªs efforts to empower citizens to hold elected councilors, Councils and government officials accountable. åÊEffort in this demand-side sub-component would be independent of the supply-side sub-component above, but would be closely coordinated to ensure that procedures, tools and capacity development were consistent. åÊDemand-side activities would focus on developing social accountability capacity and activities, in its broadest sense, in all stages in the commune calendar (participatory planning, budgeting, budget implementation, reporting and auditing). åÊThis sub-component (which supplements the IP3) is vital to ensure citizens are engaged in the decentralized decision-making process. During Project Preparation the Bank will explore the possibility of establishing options for the independent financing of civil society for citizen empowerment and social accountability in relation to the decentralization agenda.Component 4: åÊNational Management and Operational Support åÊ(IDA: US$ 3 million)27. Underpinning the 3 primary components, a 4th component of the SNDD SP will be focused on the institutional and capacity building elements of the National Management and Support program area of the IP3. åÊIt would (a) provide support to the NCDD-S Annual Work Plan and Budget, providing training and capacity building for the implementation for D&D policy, (b) strengthen the capacity of the NCDD-S to manage the execution of the NP-SNDD, and (c) support D&D performance monitoring according to the system put in place by the NCDD. åÊåÊåÊ28. Implementing Agencies: åÊThe program envisages a number of implementing agencies being involved in the SNDD-RP, under the coordination of the NCDD-S. åÊAt the national level this would include the NCDD-S and the MEF, as well as potentially including implementing agencies responsible for auditing and anti-corruption. åÊImplementing Agencies at the sub-national level include the Commune and District level Councils and Provincial Administrations. The civil society component would be executed by a non-state development partner."

It will do so by improving the institutional and technical capacity of the ministry of public works and transport for road maintenance planning, budgeting and operations, and by expanding and strengthening maintenance activities. There are three components to the project. The first component is the road asset management. This component will support the preservation of Ministry of Public Works and Transportation (MPWT's) road network through Annual Work Plans (AWPs) for periodic maintenance works and provide the necessary implementation support. The periodic maintenance works to be undertaken in the first year of the project have been defined, and in subsequent years are to be defined using the Road Management Decision Support System (RMDS) system. It will also support, increasing routine and periodic maintenance through increasing Government contributions. This will be carried out using force account, and to an increasing extent using an output or performance-based contract approach successfully piloted under Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project (PRIP). The second component is the capacity development. This component, which comprises seven subcomponents, will support the capacity development at the institutional, organizational and individual level for MPWT to perform its road asset management functions effectively and efficiently. International Development Association (IDA) financing will support four activities: (i) institutional (administrative); (ii) technical capacity development for road asset management within the General Department of Public Works (GDPW); (iii) private sector development; and (iv) HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns. Finally, the third component is the Merit Based Performance Incentive (MBPI). This component will provide funding for initiating the MBPI program in selected departments of the GDPW and the General Department of Administration and Planning (GDAP) of MPWT."

En base a los proyectos 07-CAP3-1522 y 09-CAP1-0855 cuyos resultados hacen patente de reforzar los Objetivos del Milenio 3, 4 y 5, hemos optado por reforzar aquellas estructuras del gobierno, encaminadas a la consecuciÌ_n de los mismos. Se han identificado dos estructuras: una relativa al Ministerio de la Mujer (MoWA) y otra al Ministerio de la Salud (MoH). La primera estructura consiste en una novedosa red de Promotoras de GÌ©nero (PG), creada por PSF ONGD y MoWA en los proyectos ya mencionados, que se amplia, se refuerza, se consolida y se trasfiere al MoWA. La segunda estructura abarca a varios Ministerios que se plasma a nivel provincial, involucrando a personal gubernamental de la Provincia, de los Distritos y de las Comunas que representan intereses para la poblaciÌ_n en distintos aspectos, siendo los que ataÌ±en a los derechos de la mujer los que preocupan en el presente proyecto. Por todo ello, se diseÌ±a la persecuciÌ_n de dos amplios resultados que pretenden el objetivo comÌ¼n de empoderar a la mujer indÌ_gena en aspectos psicosociales, que abarcan tanto desde la promociÌ_n de conductas saludables tanto para la mujer como para sus pequeÌ±os, como la promociÌ_n de su propia autoestima y su propia protecciÌ_n ante la violencia domÌ©stica mediante sensibilizaciÌ_n a la poblaciÌ_n de hombres y mujeres indÌ_genas. El proyecto beneficia indirectamente a toda la poblaciÌ_n indÌ_gena de la provincia de Ratanakiri (censo 2008: 91,845 hab) y en especial de los 5 distritos (66,374 hab) donde se forman 16,212 mujeres en edad reproductiva, ya que estÌÁ estructurado de manera que, en contraparte con el Mowa, formando a 347 PG formadoras se capacita a la poblaciÌ_n femenina de sus aldeas a actuar como agente activo de cambio de conductas saludables que benefician tanto a las mujeres como al conjunto de la comunidad. En contraparte con el MoH se capacita a hombres y mujeres que desde distintos ministerios realizan tareas que estÌÁn implicadas en la problemÌÁtica de la violencia domÌ©stica. Con la dos contrapartes ya mencionadas se realizan grupos de discusiÌ_n sobre violencia domÌ©stica en el que participan de forma activa los hombres y mujeres de los 153 poblados indÌ_genas en 5 de los 9 distritos de la provincia de Ratanakiri.

khm_1914,Ending Violence Against Women - program design,ENDING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN - PROGRAM DESIGN,"Ending violence against women and girls at home, in their communities and in disaster and conflict situations is one of the four pillars of Australia's gender equality strategy. This strategy highlights that a more strategic and targeted focus is needed in areas where progress has been slow and that the highest levels of expenditure will be in the countries with the most severe gender gaps. Cambodia meets this criterion as it ranks 99 out of 145 countries in the Gender Inequality Index (GII) of the 2011 Human Development Report (HDR), which is one of the lowest rankings in the region. The program will work with the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MOWA) of the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), the Ministries of Interior and Justice (through CCJAP) and Cambodian Civil Society to deliver a comprehensive response to VAW. In the short term, we will: support the development of a new National Action Plan on Violence Against Women (NAPVAW) that is fully costed, evidence based, and developed in consultation with communities, survivors of violence, Civil Society Organisations (CSO) and whole of government, to identify a comprehensive and coordinated response to VAW; and b) support a prevalence study that will ensure resources are well targeted need. In the medium term (July-December) the program will undertake a joint design with UN Women to: 1) identify the best modality for civil society support for providing victim assistance services, legal aid, advocacy and community awareness/behaviour change; and 2) assess the feasibility of integrating the legal enforcement aspects of the NAPVAW into the new phase of assistance to the justice sector); andlonger term we will have: i) an Agreement with UN Women to manage a civil society program window; and ii) integrated feasible components of NAPVAW into the 2013 CCJAP Annual Plans, leveraging additional funding to make real improvements.

La producciÌ_n agropecuaria se caracteriza por ser de subsistencia, lo que repercute en que no se alcancen unos niveles de seguridad alimentaria mÌ_nimos necesarios. La mujer, en el entorno rural, convive con una situaciÌ_n de desigualdad notable. A pesar de participar en todas las tareas necesarias para la producciÌ_n y comercializaciÌ_n de pescado, tiene vetado el acceso a la toma de decisiones de las explotaciones, a la formaciÌ_n tÌ©cnica y al control de los recursos generados. El objetivo general del proyecto es incorporar la problemÌÁtica de gÌ©nero en la producciÌ_n acuÌ_cola y el acceso al consumo de pescado de calidad para el desarrollo sostenible de la acuicultura en el Noreste de Camboya, tiene una duraciÌ_n de 12 meses y cuenta con un presupuesto total de 272.330? (Anexo 1 Presupuesto desglosado). Para el logro del objetivo planteado se implementarÌÁn acciones basadas en tres componentes fundamentales. 1. La implementaciÌ_n de una estrategia de integraciÌ_n de hombres y mujeres en todas las fases productivas del sector, a travÌ©s de la imparticiÌ_n de talleres a funcionarios y productores en temÌÁticas de equidad de gÌ©nero aplicadas a actividades agropecuarias, el desarrollo de un paquete de extensionismo acuÌ_cola especÌ_fico de integraciÌ_n de la mujer y el apoyo directo a mujeres en situaciones de desigualdad en el inicio y desarrollo de producciones acuÌ_colas. 2. El fortalecimiento institucional del DAD (19 funcionarios directamente implicados en la ejecuciÌ_n del proyecto) facilitando instrumentos tÌ©cnicos necesarios para dotar de consistencia al sector, a travÌ©s de un incremento de la calidad de la producciÌ_n y de la organizaciÌ_n estratÌ©gica del mismo. Para ello se identificarÌÁn ÌÁreas de alta potencialidad productiva, se establecerÌÁn nexos entre productores, distribuidores y vendedores, asegurando la participaciÌ_n de la mujer en todo el proceso, con la implementaciÌ_n de una estrategia de integraciÌ_n equitativa de hombre y mujer aplicada al sector acuÌ_cola en Camboya. 3. Apoyo tÌ©cnico y material a 400 granjas de engorde y 8 de producciÌ_n de alevines, con el objetivo de mejorar la calidad higiÌ©nico-sanitaria de las raciones, incrementar la producciÌ_n anual de las explotaciones y optimizar las relaciones comerciales a travÌ©s de la creaciÌ_n de redes de productores acuÌ_colas en las 4 provincias. De manera global se tendrÌÁn en cuenta aspectos de sostenibilidad medioambiental, fomentando aquellas herramientas acuÌ_colas mÌÁs respetuosas con el medio y proveyendo a las instituciones de las herramientas y la informaciÌ_n que les permitan una planificaciÌ_n ordenada y controlada de la acuicultura."

Primarily, these changes are related to the spread of direct seeding, a significant increase in the proportion of irrigated rice and the replacement of animal draught for machinery for field preparation. This project is focused on the first of these changes, addressing some of the common constraints to high productivity such as excessive weed infestation, uneven crop emergence and poor water control. This will be achieved through the increased capacity of machinery in both direct seeded rice and conservation tillage, also leading to timelier crop establishment, reduced weeding costs and better water management. The Cambodia Agricultural Value Chain Program (CAVAC) will support extension of the project and help create better policy and market environment for the dissemination of new agricultural machinery and herbicides. Through this project, Cambodia will have tested and improved methods of direct seeding rice, with benefits flowing directly to Cambodian smallholders."

There are four components to the project. The first component concerns commune based social land concession planning and land allocation. This component will provide training, incremental operating costs, goods, and contracted technical services to commune councils to prepare plans for SLC sub-projects. The second component concerns rural development services and investments. This component will provide subproject grants for the commune councils, working with the Land Recipients (LRs), to contract civil works, goods, technical assistance and training services identified in approved SLC sub-project plans. The third component concerns sustainable and transparent program development and will provide funding for technical assistance, salary incentives, training, incremental operating costs, small civil works, and vehicles and goods. At the national level, the component will support the General Secretariat for Social Land Concessions (GSSLC) for nationwide activities of information dissemination, technical and policy backstopping for provinces and evaluation of Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development Project (LASED) and SLC experiences to inform additional policy and institutional development in support of SLCs and potential program expansion.

The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), in line with a recent joint donor evaluation of the sector, estimates that most of the negative socio-economic impact of landmines could be dealt with by clearing 427 square kilometers of high priority land over the next 10 to 15 years. RGC has requested donor assistance for this purpose, including inter alia the creation of a pooled funding mechanism targeting mine clearance resources on development priorities, as established by the Provincial Mine Action Committees and the Cambodian Mine Action Authority, in cooperation with concerned line ministries and development partners. This new multi-donor funding facility for mine clearance has been designed to address current efficiency and transparency issues, support a systematic integration of mine clearance with national and provincial development plans and programmes, and follow the principles of the åÒDeclaration by the Government of Cambodia and Donors on Harmonization and AlignmentåÓ, signed on 2 December 2004. The main project activities will include:establishing and operating a new demining fund that will include (1) a new approach to funding the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) that promotes a clearer focus on results and cost-efficiency and (2) the possibility of competitive bidding; developing and implementing a strategy for resource mobilization for the fund; building national capacities to provide independent quality assurance and dedicating the fundåÕs resources to national and provincial priorities established through a Government-led, decentralized, participatory planning process."

In 2010, three monitoring visits will be undertaken to Concern in Sierra Leone, TrÌ_caire and Self Help Africa (locations for the latter two to be decided). GOAL and Christian AidÛªs field monitoring visits were undertaken in 2009. The planned evaluation, field monitoring and other work in the sector will feed into the development of a new performance-linked modality of funding NGOs in 2011/12. An amount of âÂ0.5m will cover monitoring and auditing expenses associated with the partnership."

Such issues are of considerable relevance to Cambodia. The S. Rajaratnam School for International Studies (RSIS) has managed a program on nontraditional security issues since 1999. In 2007 RSIS launched a consortium on Non-Traditional Security Studies in Asia (NTS-Asia), which currently comprises 14 member institutes in 10 countries. NTS-Asia would like to expand its outreach and include a Cambodian institution in its membership, but this is not feasible in the short term. As a first step in building Cambodian capacity in nontraditional security, this grant will allow two Cambodian research fellows to spend a period of five months in the nontraditional security program at RSIS. The two will be selected by open competition based on submission of a research proposal. Each will give a seminar and produce a publishable paper or monograph by the end of the fellowship"

This may be due either to low reported incidence of tobacco-related disease or to lack of available treatment for anything other than infectious disease or trauma. Policymakers have expressed the need for convincing and reliable information on the health costs of smoking, particularly as a long-awaited draft tobacco-control law is due for Parliamentary approval and an increase in tobacco taxation is also awaited. This research project proposes to generate knowledge about the health care costs directly attributable to active tobacco use and the productivity losses indirectly attributable to active tobacco use. It will be limited to the examination of the costs associated with five disease groups: Lung cancers, tuberculosis (TB), ischemic heart disease, stroke (cerebro-vascular disease) and chronic-obstructive-pulmonary disease. It will not estimate the costs associated with second-hand smoke, the cost of tobacco purchase or the cost of using tobacco products that are not smoked. There is strong evidence from other countries that smoking increases the tuberculosis infection rate and reduces the tuberculosis survival rate. Due to the high rates of both TB and smoking in Cambodia, the cost of tobacco use will include the cost of tobacco-related excess TB. Due to a weak and unreliable health information system in Cambodia, data will be collected only in major health facilities of Phnom Penh and large regional facilities. The annual number of cases will be determined through the local health information databases and the health service personnel. Costs per case will be determined through surveys and interviews of Health personnel. Indirect costs due to productivity losses will be calculated using secondary data on Disability Adjusted Life Years estimated by the World Health Organisation. A small number of case studies will also be conducted to determine the costs to individuals and families resulting from treatment and care of tobacco-caused disease."

Les objectifs sp?cifiques (OS) pr?sent?s dans ce programme sont une composante d?une action plus large d?HIB qui inclut des th?matiques compl?mentaires et qui sont pr?sent?es ? d?autres bailleurs de fonds (par exemple l??conomie sociale, le VIH/Sida).Le volet Nord comprend 2 OS pour les ann?es 2010-2013, compos?s de deux th?matiques sur lesquelles l?association travaille d?ailleurs ?galement dans le Sud : ?l?appui aux associations de personnes en situation de handicap ?la recherche, le plaidoyer et l?information sur les mines, armes ? sous-munitions et autres restes explosifs de guerre. Le premier OS cible l?engagement d?associations belges de personnes handicap?es pour travailler avec des associations du Sud. Le second est un objectif permettant ? l?ONG de continuer ses actions de lobbying sur les mines et armes ? sous-munitions, en se focalisant d?sormais plus pr?cis?ment sur l?assistance aux victimes. Le Volet Nord sera d?velopp? en lien plus ?troit avec les actions dans le Sud. Le point commun entre ces deux th?matiques est leur r?f?rence au droit, en particulier au Trait? d?Interdiction des Mines (ainsi qu?? un futur Trait? sur les armes ? sous-munitions) et, surtout, ? la nouvelle Convention internationale sur les Droits des personnes en situation de handicap, adopt?e en d?cembre 2006.Le volet Sud se compose de 5 objectifs sp?cifiques qui concernent 12 pays (Angola, B?nin, Bolivie, Burundi, Cambodge, Chine, Colombie, Cor?e du Nord, Cuba, Laos, RDC et Vietnam) et une vingtaine de contextes d?intervention. L?ONG a donc d?cid? de modifier partiellement son champ d?intervention en y int?grant deux nouveaux pays : la Bolivie et le B?nin et en se retirant progressivement de l?Angola et de la Cor?e du Nord.Les objectifs du volet Sud concernent la pr?vention/s?curit? routi?re, la sant? maternelle et infantile, la r?adaptation ? base communautaire, l?appui aux associations et la revalidation des personnes handicap?es.

Government is currently working with the donor community on a broad program of development and repair that includes strengthening the institutional capacity of the network operator, Royal Cambodian Railways, and upgrading the physical infrastructure. The OFID sponsored project is part of this wider program and involves rehabilitation of both the Northern and Southern Lines, 335 km and 254 km in length respectively, together with reconstruction of a 48-km stretch linking the Northern Line to the Thai border. This was completely destroyed during the war and its absence remains a serious hindrance to cross-border trade and sub-regional integration.

The project will establish a Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) that will partially guarantee a portfolio of newly-originated loans to agribusinesses. The objective of the RSF is to immediately accelerate commercial banks' lending to agribusinesses. The RSF structure will reimburse the Participating Financial Intermediary (PFI) for a fixed percentage (50 percent) of incurred losses, which is expected to provide them with the credit protection needed to mitigate the perceived high risk of agribusiness Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) lending. Finally, the second component is the International Finance Corporation (IFC) technical assistance. The program addresses a wide range of constraints hindering effective operations of agribusinesses and SME in Cambodia, including issues related to the risks involved in lending to this sector, while tackling also the broader policy, regulatory and institutional constraints that hamper the efficiency of SME business operations and their ability to access finance."

Animal tracking is imperative to improving biosecurity and effective planning of livestock development programs, but this has proved too difficult to successfully implement via regulatory or physical means in areas such as the Mekong region. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has identified as a priority the development and introduction of novel diagnostic techniques. The aim of this study is to determine the potential of soil fingerprinting techniques - developed for purposes such as criminal forensics, geological exploration and archaeology - to provide evidence for animal origin in the Mekong context."

The high level of poverty in Cambodia is largely due to poor rice yields, which lag behind its Asian neighbours by up to 50 per cent. Temporal and spatial water availability in Cambodia is scarce, and crops are prone to stress due to drought and poor irrigation management. This project aims to enhance the livelihood of rice farmers through increased water productivity and reduced yield variability, leading to increased water security and reduced agronomic investment risk. The primary objectives of this project are to develop an understanding of farm-level water management constraints and opportunities, and to research and develop adapted water management interventions at a farm and district level. Research will be undertaken in three provinces: Kampong Thom, Takeo and Kampot."

Slow economic growth and high commodity prices have intensified food security and poverty reduction concerns in Cambodia. CAVAC aims to achieve accelerated growth in the value of ag production and smallholder income initially focussing on rice, fruit and vegetable in the rice based farming systems of 3 selected provinces (Kampong Thom, Kampot and Takeo). The A$48 million program has been designed to address key systemic failures along the agriculture value chain from supplier to consumer.To enable higher productivity and incomes, CAVAC will strengthen market connections that promote greater investment and add value along specific product value chains that link suppliers to farmers and farmers to consumers. Key stakeholders include Min of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Min of Water Resources & Meteorology(MOWRAM), CARDI, Provincial Administrations, Private sector and other Dev't Partners in the ag sector. The program design started in March 2007 with the implementation of interim activities from Sept 2007 to June 2009 to document lessons learnt and to scale up these activities in the next full implementation phase. The full implmentation will commence in third quarter 2009. and complete in June 2014. The Program has 4 main delivery components that are designed to be implemented in a coordinated, mutually reinforcing manner: 1. Agribusiness Development: Strengthened agribusiness activity results in increased smallholder farmer income. 2. Water Management & Irrigation: Sustainable increase in the area and yield of irrigated crops. 3. Research & Extension: Research and extension activities alleviate key value chain constraints. 4.

This has resulted in reduced crop diversity, declining soil fertility and erosion. Expansion of cropping has coincided with a 20 per cent increase in the cost of farm labour since 2004 resulting in transition to tractors for cultivation and planting crops. Now only 5 per cent of cattle are used as draught animals compared to the national average of 28 per cent. Despite this, cattle numbers are increasing in the region-associated with increasing demand for beef. With an ample supply of crop residues and potential for production of forages, there are opportunities for profitable beef production from cattle in the region. This project will shift the focus from subsistence-based food security interventions to sustainable food security through diversification, generation of cash income and commercialisation. The engagement of the commercial and education sectors as well as research and extension providers will ensure development and delivery of viable alternative commercial crop and livestock enterprises."

khm_0278,Kantha Bopha Hospital,KANTHA BOPHA HOSPITAL,"Dr. Beat Richner, a well known Swiss pediatric doctor, has been managing since 1991 pediatric hospitals in Cambodia on the invitation of the Government of Cambodia. Currently hospitals are located in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, consisting of several sites (known as Kantha Bopha Hospitals I to V). In 2008, 34.55 millions CHF were raised to cover the costs of the hospitals coming mainly from private donations (about 86.2%), from the Cambodian Government (about 5.2%) and from the Swiss Government (through SDC, about 8.6%, or 3 millions CHF/year). It is estimated that about 80% of all hospital pediatric care in the country is provided by Kantha Bopha. The medical service is free of charge and of high standards. About 2000 staff members are employed among which only two are international. SDC has the Kantha Bopha Foundation, based in Zurich as its interlocutor. SDC has been supporting the Kantha Bopha since 1994. 5 external evaluations were carried out in 1995, 1997, 2001, 2003 and 2006. Additionally a self assessment was done in 2007. In 2009, SDC came to the conclusion that a new external evaluation would bring very limited new elements, as the project has not changed much in the last 5 years. It was considered more important to check how the numerous recommendations made between 1995 and 2006 have been implemented. Therefore, during the summer 2009, a SDC staff member in charge of quality assurance reviewed all recommendations made so fare and updated accordingly the list of topics to be regularly discussed between SDC and the Kantha Bopha Foundation during its annual meeting. SDC and the Kantha Bopha Foundation have a yearly dialogue to discuss critical issues, such as: A long term vision including the financial and institutional sustainability as well as a succession plan of Dr. Richner and diversification of incomes. The interaction and gradual integration of Kantha Bopha in the Cambodian Health system A more strategic planning and reporting of the foundation (to reach SDC standards). Around 2003, the dialogue between SDC and Kantha Bopha (Dr. Richner) was difficult and criticism were made through (interviews in) the media. This situation has changed since 1) SDC has the Foundation and no longer Dr. Richer as an interlocutor and 2) SDC has formalized a regular dialogue with a list of topics for discussion that focus no longer on medical issues but on institutional and financial sustainability. This project is highly supported by the Swiss public (the fundraising reaches about 25 millions CHF/yr in Switzerland through private donors), is well known and regularly covered by the Swiss media, does a praised professional medical work with clearly identified impact for Cambodia. Development aspects are not sufficiently taken into consideration and long term perspectives are clearly of concern to SDC (heavy dependence on the person of Dr. Richner, parallel structure from the Ministry of Health). SDC discuss all critical points yearly with the Kantha"

khm_2401,HIV/AIDS - Increasing Coverage in Key Service Areas,,"Background and Summary: Estimated adult HIV prevalence has declined from a peak of 2.0% in 1998 to 0.9% in 2006. Of the 71,100 people living with HIV (PLHIV) aged 0-49 years in 2006, an estimated 33,100 were in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART). By 2010 the number in need of ART is expected to increase to 38,600. A key conclusion from the 2007 Consensus Workshop on HIV Estimates and Projections is that prevalence in the general population has declined and will stabilize, if interventions are sustained. The main risk of a second-wave of HIV infections occurring in Cambodia is from female sex workers, their clients and sweethearts. Men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users I drug users (ICU/DU) may also be significant contributors to any second-wave of HIV infections. Populations who may be especially vulnerable to HIV infection are female partners of high-risk males, mobile populations, and urban and out-of-school youth (excerpted from Revised National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, 2006-2010). Three key conclusions guide future direction: 1) It cannot be assumed incidence will remain low changes in the structure of the commercial sex industry and the difficulty of sustaining prevention programs in brothels where there is a high turnover of sex workers, along with the possibility of significant epidemics among MSM and IDU/DU, mean that sustaining and improving prevention efforts to maintain the reduction in HIV incidence will need to attract high priority; 2) the maturing epidemic means that there are a growing number of PLHIV in need of ART. Delivering on the commitment to provide long-term Universal Access to ART and associated care and support will need to be a continuing high priority; 3) the high death rate from AIDS has resulted in many orphans and widows. PLHIV, especially those with advanced stage HIV, have high social and economic support needs. Meeting the substantial impact mitigation needs for those already infected and affected needs to be a key priority (excerpted from Revised National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, 2006-2010). This latest adult HIV prevalence estimate is in line with past trends. While sex work largely determined the course of the Cambodian epidemic in the early and mid 1990s, producing 90 percent of new infections and 70 percent in 1995, the success of condom promotion efforts for commercial sex workers and clients has changed modes of transmission. The 2003 and 2006 data of the HSS showed that HIV prevalence among sex workers was falling. Furthermore, a gap between HIV prevalence between younger and older sex workers suggests that incidence is falling as well (HSS, 2004 & 2006). Likewise, the prevalence rate among police has fallen. Generally, the number of men (15-49 years) infected has decreased sharply from 100,000 in 1998 to an estimated 32,200 in 2006. The number of infected women remained less drastically changed and was estimated to be 32,000 in 2006. The numbers of new infections show a similar trend: From a peak of approximately 24,000 new HIV infections/year among men in 1994, the number of new HIV infections/year among men has decreased to approximately 1,350 per year as of 2006. The prevalence rate among pregnant women tested at antenatal care (ANC) sites has stabilised. This provides for a situation where women have an increasing share in the overall number of infected persons. From 35% in 1997 the proportion of infected women rose to 47% in 2003. The main route of transmission is now between spouses as well as mother-tochild transmission. Prevention interventions are being carried out by private, not-for-profit as well as public sector agencies. The work with high risk groups is considered a success. The 100% condom use programme has been highly successful for high risk groups, notably brothel based commercial sex workers. This has also been a good example of collaboration among line ministries as members of several provincial departments join the provincial condom use working group. Social marketing of condoms is being undertaken, even though remote rural areas are underserved. A network of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) clinics is being established at provincial and district level.  Both government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) provide services in these fields. The role and extent of the private sector is not known. However, the degree of selfmedication is high among the Cambodian population. The provision of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment has been substantially scaled up, notably with Global Fund resources starting Round 4. The approach to Continuum of Care (CoC) encompasses public health structures as well as home based care, which is being carried out by community based organizations (CBOs). The CoC aims to provide medical care and support for children and adults infected by HIV. The large number of deaths from HIV and PLHIV means large numbers of children are missing one or both parents, or living with sick parents. Efforts are surging to provide services and support to orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) to ensure that these children grow up in a community setting. Secondary analysis of 2005 CDHS data report 8.8% of children aged 0-17 years as orphans (one or both parents died); 6.1% of children aged 0-17 years have a chronically ill parent; 14.4% of children aged 0-17 years are orphaned and/or have a chronically ill parent (from NAA 2008 UNGASS report). 8.8% of children are approximately 580,000 children.

This will be achieved through a special focus on the development of transitional justice strategies in the country and the strengthening of the work done by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). This objective will be met by focusing on three specific outcomes: Strengthening the capacity of local civil society to advocate for, influence, and support effective transitional justice mechanisms. Strengthening the technical skills of the ECCC and justice sector officials to implement sound transitional justice policies. Activities and Outputs: Measure 1: Strengthening the capacity of local civil society to advocate for, influence, and support effective transitional justice mechanisms. Deploy an in country expert, supported by headquarters-based ICTJ staff and experts providing technical expertise and materials. The expert will give ongoing advice and mentoring to local NGOs on the development of transitional justice strategies. Organize face-to-face training through a TJ åÒEssentials CourseåÓ for 30 civil society selected participants. This component will be implemented through a subcontract with the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee (a coalition of human rights NGOs), in close coordination with the ECCC itself (particularly the victimsåÕ unit). Provide participants with a package of resource materials on transitional justice. Create a network of Transitional Justice experts in Cambodia. These trainees will be encouraged to remain in contact with each other after the face to face training by organizing meetings and informal discussion groups. They will also be encouraged to enter into contact with their counterparts in other countries through the contact facilitated by the ICTJ, joining a network of civil society actors working on transitional justice within the region and globally. Measure 2: Strengthening the technical skills of the ECCC and justice sector officials to implement sound transitional justice policies. Mentor a network of local NGOs who are monitoring the ECCC to ensure that transitional justice principles are incorporated into public analysis of the ECCCåÕs work. Through the CSDåÕs Courtwatch project and the soon to be established CHRAC working group on monitoring the ECCC, hold regular meetings with the main NGOs working on ECCC issues to foster an active network of monitors, sharing practical techniques and information, as well as ensuring the greatest coordination between efforts. Work with local and international monitors to ensure that evaluation of the ECCCåÕs progress encompasses both compliance with international fair trial standards, as well as broader transitional justice factors such as public legitimacy, transparency and transformative effects on the prevailing culture of impuni"

CBF is attractive as it is low-cost, mobilises dry land farming communities (e.g. rice farmers) to use existing water bodies for the secondary purpose of food fish production, and when adopted, CBF brings about communal harmony and synergies within farming communities. The strategies to optimise benefits from CBF, however, vary in detail from country to country and across climatic regimes. This project, working in Laos and Cambodia, will develop a suite of BMPs, which will be applicable and adoptable to water bodies that are suitable for CBF activities, and a related dissemination package(s) to be used by governments and NGOs.

On paper, the role of local communities in resource management has been strengthened and national programs for community forestry and fisheries have been initiated. However, capacity for implementing the new policies is limited. Capacity for relevant research is also limited. This grant will support a new initiative called the Cambodia Rural Livelihoods and Natural Resources Research Programme that aims to build capacity for implementing the new policies. Essentially a community of practice, the Programme is made up of staff from several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations involved in community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) projects in the area of forestry, fisheries, coastal resources and protected areas.

khm_3691,Renewed efforts to achieve high coverage of proven malaria control interventions and scaling up the response to high anti-malarial drug resistance in Cambodia,,"Although the burden of malaria in Cambodia has been declining steadily in recent years, it is still the leading cause of hospital mortality and in forested areas many hyperendemic foci remain. Bednet coverage in high risk areas is high but ITN coverage is low despite retreatment efforts (20% in 2004). Cambodia is also right at the centre of the global multi-drug resistant malaria problem. Cambodia is already successfully implementing malaria control activities supported by two GF grants. Nevertheless, as identified during two recent external reviews (conducted by WHO and DFID), significant programmatic gaps still exist (in part due to the recent advances in the field of malaria control) and these programmatic gaps will widen very significantly when GF R2 comes to an end in 2008. The current proposal therefore builds on the activities supported under existing grants, complementing them and adding to them as necessary, and provides for continued implementation of these strengthened activities when the existing grants come to an end. With GF R6 support the NMCP will take full advantage of cost effective new technologies such as LLINs and RDTs. The total estimated budget for this proposal over 5 years is US$29.99 million. The overall goal is to reduce malaria related mortality and morbidity among the population living in high-risk areas in line with CambodiaÌ¢??s MDGs. The number of severe malaria cases and the case fatality rate will be drastically reduced and the susceptibility of P.falciparum to the new first-line treatment will be maintained at above 85%. Key beneficiaries will be the 1.6 million (M) people living within 1 km of the forest (8% ethnic minority groups) and 300,000 temporary forest goers. Another 0.4M people at elevated risk (living 1-2 km from the forest) will be targeted through social marketing initiatives. Within these populations, vulnerable sub-groups (pregnant women and children under 5) will be specifically targeted. Objective 1 is to halt the development and prevent the spread of antimalarial drug resistance. Activities to address the underlying causes of drug resistance development will be concentrated in the 7 western provinces bordering Thailand where the problem is centred. The Department of Drugs and Food (DDF), will establish regulatory and policy guidelines on antimalarial drugs and adverse drug monitoring and post marketing surveillance systems. Intersectoral committees will be set up at provincial level to deal with counterfeit drugs. Rational use of antimalarials will be promoted through training of private providers and through a well coordinated high quality BCC campaign. A high-tec facility will be established at the CNM for in-house monitoring of drug resistance.  Objective 2 is to improve access to and utilization of effective diagnosis and treatment for malaria. The public sector will improve the availability, quality and use of antimalarial drugs and diagnostics in public health facilities through: procurement of first-line drugs (700,000 ACT doses), RDTs (1.3M) and microscopes; improvement of drug management through DDF (forecasting and drug request and management system at OD level); improvement of diagnosis and case-management practices through training and improved referral of severely ill patients; community-based EDAT in selected highly endemic and remote communities; and, introduction of malaria screening of pregnant women in ANC clinics in high risk areas. The private sector will continue to offer ACT (0.89M doses) and RDTs (1.7M) through an established social marketing approach (PSI). Objective 3 is to improve access to and utilization of effective malaria prevention measures. The public sector will deliver 870,000 LLINs to 1.6M people living in high risk communities within 1 km of the forest. To maximise sustainability and cost effectiveness (and take supply issues into consideration), distribution of LLINs will be phased (200,000 per year to reach total coverage by year 4). Nevertheless, with MoH support for conventional bednets during years 1 to 3, coverage of ITNs is expected to exceed 95% from year 1. It is expected that this intervention will significantly reduce malaria transmission. Through the private sector 80,000 long lasting insecticide treated hammock nets and 90,000 long lasting insecticide treatment kits2 will be sold through targeted social marketing. Additional stocks will be procured using funds generated by sales. Objective 4 is to strengthen the management of the national malaria control effort especially at operational levels. A national malaria management information system will be developed. Coordination mechanisms will be strengthened at HC and commune levels, participatory planning efforts will be supported at commune level. Stakeholders will be engaged at community level to carry out malaria control activities including referral. Regular malaria workshops will be supported at PHD/OD levels and inter-province study tours between will be conducted. To strengthen overall capacity, a long-term advisor will be recruited to provide management and technical support to the CNM. The CNM will develop a basic needs-based package of operational research. Infrastructure will be strengthened according to needs. Programme progress will be assessed by means of routine monitoring augmented by mid-term and end of project external evaluations."

khm_3803,"Scaling up interventions for HIV Prevention, Treatment, Care and Mitigation for Vulberable and Marginalized Populations at Risk",,"Background and Summary: The HIV epidemic in Cambodia is changing from a generalised epidemic to a concentrated one. This creates a situation where interventions are needed to target previously overlooked but high-risk groups such as drug users (DU), particularly injecting drug users (IDU), sex workers (SW) and men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). Further, the impact of years of a generalised epidemic needs to be addressed. That is, a comprehensive strategy for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) must be developed and made operational; and for the large number of people in Cambodia who are now HIV infected, treatment must be assured through a consolidation of 1st line treatment. Harmonisation of efforts will only be achieved through multisectoral planning and country ownership of the national response. Therefore, this proposal seeks funding to ensure a coordinated effort through support to various multisectoral bodies, including a joint government and donor working group and strategy specific working groups such as those related to illicit drug users, men-who-have-sex-with-men, orphans and vulnerable children and sex workers. This proposal addresses HIV/AIDS related needs of high-risk and vulnerable populations including MSM, IDU, DU, SW and OVC by developing, implementing and strengthening interventions related to prevention, treatment and care of these groups. It is also proposed that Continuum of Care (CoC) be consolidated, so that people living with HIV/AIDS in Cambodia, including vulnerable populations, have ongoing access to essential HIV/AIDS medicines and services. This proposal aims to meet many national goals as set out in the Cambodian National Strategic Plan for a comprehensive and Multisectoral Response to HIV/AIDS 2006-2010 (NSP II).

The White Paper on the Australian Governments Overseas Aid Program released in mid 2006, outlined a comprehensive approach to doubling Australia'a aid budget to aproximately AUD4 billion by 2010.This new policy directive identifies four themes for the aid program including increased support to social sectors.As a key theme of the White Paper, Investing in People prioritises health and education and outlines an approach to increased health assistance which focuses on basic services for women and children and on tackling major diseases such as HIV/AIDs and malaria. In response to the White Paper and an expected increase in bilateral funds in 07/08, the Cambodia Program undertook preliminary investigations to assess opportunities for future development assistance to the health sector in Cambodia.In October 2006, an Identification Mission was deployed to Cambodia."

Discussions of the Working Group on Economic Cooperation (WGEC) at the 8th TNC in Wellington (March 2009) focused on the architecture of an EC chapter and agreed in principle that cooperation should be focused on supporting implementation of the agreement in mutually agreed priority areas.WGEC discussions at the 9th TNC in Palembang (May/June 2007) agreed that the economic cooperation chapter under the FTA would commit Australia and NZ to delivering a concrete set of projects which are agreed by all parties prior to the signing of the FTA.This approach was agreed to ensure that there is clarity and certainty regarding the projects that will be delivered and to enable Australia and NZ to secure the necessary resources for these projects. At the 11th TNC in Kuala Lumpur(September 2007) it was agreed that a design support team of technical experts would be contracted in as soon as possible to work with the proponents of projects to refine and further develop project proposals and to generate new ideas for potential projects. In December 2005 Mr Downer announced $1.5m worth of assistance to ASEAN to assist ASEAN countries build up expertise in free trade negotiations and implementation.This initiative captures the remainder of activities to be implemented under this initiative.

khm_3227,Partnership for Going to Scale with Proven Interventions for HIV/AIDS,,"Background and Summary: Cambodia, with an adult prevalence rate of 2.6%, has the highest rate of HIV prevalence in the Asia-Pacific region. The past few years have seen a decline in the prevalence, attributed to a combination of effective prevention intervention, including a 100% condom use Program (CUP), and rising mortality of people with AIDS. Data from the HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2002 confirms that the impetus of the epidemic is declining, e.g. HIV among direct sex workers has dropped from 42.6% in 1998 to 28.8% in 2002 and among the police has decreased from 6% in 1998 to 3.9% in 2002. However, the nation still faces serious challenges of prevention and rapidly increasing challenges related to care. Recently, the most important route of transmission has moved from commercial sex circuit to the family. In 2002, there are approximately 24 new infections every day. Out of these, about 10 are transmitted from husbands to their wives, another 6 are from mothers to their babies, and 5 are from sex workers to their male partners. The importance of focusing prevention and behavior change on the family is thus evident, including the provision of nation-wide services for the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT). The other major task related to the provision of comprehensive care and support to those infected and affected by the epidemic. The negative impact of providing treatment for the escalating opportunistic infections (Ol) and sexually transmitted infections (STl) on an already fragile and over-stretched health system is evident. Access to even the most basic of these drugs is seriously lacking in many health facilities. The most important obstacle to access is affordability but legal, infrastructural, distributional and cultural factors are also serious impediment. The need for providing antiretroviral (ARVs) is escalating rapidly. The main barriers to access to ARV drugs are their high cost, combined with and unpredictable availability of the drugs and lack of trained medical personnel in the use of ARV drugs. Comprehensive care will have to include treatment for STIs and opportunistic infections for HN/AIDS, along with adequate psycho-social support through peer and other counseling. In addition to care for patients, large scale intervention for the care and support of families will be required. Planned Activities: Ì¢?å¢ Increased availability of. voluntary counseling and testing, information, education and  communication (IEC) strategies for rural villagers, PMTCT for HIV positive women, IEC and STI treatment for migrant workers and iodirect sex workers and increased awareness and safer behavior among youth. Ì¢?å¢ Provision of ARVs in Phnom Penh and Kompong Som Province, including children living with AIDS (CLWA), medical care to CLWA at the National Pediatric Hospital, laboratory monitoring for ARV patients in Phnom Penh, laboratory monitoring for OIs at the Department of Disease Control in Kompong Som Province, training of doctors in the provision of ARVs io Phnom Penh, training of doctors in AIDS care including ARV provision in Kompong Som Province, training of pharmacist, peer educator training and the organization of patient support groups. Ì¢?å¢ Improve National Guidelines on medical treatment and palliative care; increase the capacity of health facilities and communities to provide care and treatment such as or management, palliative care and counseling for family members and PMTCT."

But providing feed for cattle is a major challenge for 8 months of the year, and this problem is compounded by labour demands (up to 8 hours daily) associated with feeding cattle.

khm_0029,Cambodia Agriculture Value Chain Program,CAMBODIA AGRICULTURE VALUE CHAIN PROGRAM,"Australia has been a longstanding supporter of Cambodia's agriculture sector which is a major source of income for its rural population and crucial to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals. Slow economic growth and high commodity prices have intensified food security and poverty reduction concerns in Cambodia.CAVAC aims to achieve accelerated growth in the value of ag production and smallholder income initially focussing on rice, fruit and vegetable in the rice based farming systems of 3 selected provinces (Kampong Thom, Kampot and Takeo).The A$48 million program has been designed to address key systemic failures along the agriculture value chain from supplier to consumer.To enable higher productivity and incomes, CAVAC will strengthen market connections that promote greater investment and add value along specific product value chains that link suppliers to farmers and farmers to consumers.Key stakeholders include Min of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Min of Water Resources & Meteorology(MOWRAM), CARDI, Provincial Administrations, Private sector and other Dev't Partners in the ag sector.The program design started in March 2007 with the implementation of interim activities from Sept 2007 to June 2009 to document lessons learnt and to scale up these activities in the next full implementation phase. The full implmentation will commence in third quarter 2009. and complete in June 2014.The Program has 4 main delivery components that are designed to be implemented in a coordinated, mutually reinforcing manner:1. Agribusiness Development: Strengthened agribusiness activity results in increased smallholder farmer income.2. Water Management & Irrigation: Sustainable increase in the area and yield of irrigated crops.3. Research & Extension: Research and extension activities alleviate key value chain constraints.4. Business Enabling Environment: Improved regulatory and investment framework results in increased agribusiness investment."

The sequence of financial reforms in Cambodia has been guided by the Government's 10-year FSDS. A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for $850,000 ($700,000 from ADB TASF IV) was approved in April 2010 to help the Government update the FSDS 2006-2015 and formulate the next cluster program. IMF and World Bank have recently completed the first financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on Cambodia that will provide useful inputs to the update of the 10-year FSDS. While FSP I has been rated successful by the independent evaluation department (IED), some of the reform measures were not widely enforced due to weak interministerial coordination and capacity constraint. Prepared within the framework of the updated FSDS, the next program cluster (FSP III) will help complete some of the reform programs that commenced during FSP II, strengthen the enforcement of completed activities, and commence reform activities in leasing, capital market, and pension fund. The expected overall impact of the cluster program is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance mobilization of financial resources to support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome of the FSP III is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. FSP III was approved in November 2011. The National Bank of Cambodia will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC) will be the Implementing Agencies."

As a key theme of the White Paper, Investing in People prioritises health and education and outlines an approach to increased health assistance which focuses on basic services for women and children and on tackling major diseases such as HIV/AIDs and malaria.In response to the White Paper and an expected increase in bilateral funds in 07/08, the Cambodia Program undertook preliminary investigations to assess opportunities for future development assistance to the health sector in Cambodia.

Sector-wide management significantly increases opportunities for coordination of efforts and provides flexibility for the allocation of scarce resources.
